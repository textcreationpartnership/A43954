            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Author's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE War maintain'd by the Confederate Princes againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> being the Subject of the Hopes as well as inquiſitive Diſcourſes of all <hi>Europe,</hi> I thought I might do good Service to the Publick, by communicating to the World theſe Memoires of the <hi>Venetian Conqueſts,</hi> having receiv'd them from an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of thoſe Exploits. It may be ſaid of the <hi>Turks</hi> in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſternation, that they are half vanquiſh'd before they are
<pb facs="tcp:31594:4"/>aſſaulted. The Chriſtian Armies have by their late Victories, made themſelves ſo formidable, that they ſtrike Terrour and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Infidels: We have Examples of it in the <hi>Morea;</hi> where, upon the firſt approach of the <hi>Venetiens,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> quitted <hi>Patras,</hi> the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Lepant, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Miſitra,</hi> and whatever was under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in that Country. But that which makes moſt for the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> Glory, is, That thoſe Places which the <hi>Turks</hi> never durſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with leſs than an hundred or an hundred and fifty thouſand men, were by them ſubdued with a far inferior number: So that if we conſider the ſwiftneſs of their Conqueſts, we may eaſily believe that Republique to be in a good
<pb facs="tcp:31594:4"/>Capacity of recovering its ancient Grandeur, and that it will have a great ſhare in the Glory of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing that vaſt <hi>Coloſſus</hi> which has ſo long been the Terrour of all Chriſtendom. The Loſſes it has ſuffered ſince the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> are well known. <hi>Salonica</hi> the richeſt City of <hi>Macedon,</hi> was taken from it by <hi>Amurat</hi> II. who deſtroy'd that famous Wall that ſtop'd his paſſage, and ſecur'd that Seigneurie from his Invaſions. In the year 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. <hi>Mahomet</hi> II. ſeiz'd himſelf of <hi>Negropont,</hi> and part of the <hi>Morea</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> having a ſecond time ruin'd the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Wall which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had rebuilt. In the year 1500. <hi>Bajazet</hi> II. took from them <hi>Lepante, Coron, Modon,</hi> and <hi>Duras. Selimus</hi> II. poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in the
<pb facs="tcp:31594:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>year 1570. <hi>Canea</hi> and <hi>Retimo</hi> in <hi>Candia</hi> were taken by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and laſtly the Capital City of the Iſland fell into the hands of <hi>Mahomet</hi> IV. who was ſince dethron'd. But by the following Relation of what has paſs'd from 1684. to this preſent year, it will appear, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> wiſely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of a happy juncture of times, have recover'd a great part of what the <hi>Turks,</hi> during the courſe of ſo many years, had taken from them. In a word, here are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet forth the moſt important Circumſtances of ſo great an Action.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31594:9"/>ſooner declar'd, but he retir'd from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> in the habit of a Seaman, and embarqued himſelf, together with ſome principal <hi>Venetians,</hi> in a Frenchman of War call'd the <hi>Faithful,</hi> commanded by Monſieur <hi>Bidaut,</hi> who came as a Convoy to ſome other Ships. But the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of his Houſhold, with ſix other Servants had the misfortune to be taken; the Merchants in the mean time taking refuge at the French Embaſſador's, where the Caïmacam of <hi>Constantinople</hi> would have made ſearch after Sieur <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello,</hi> but the Ambaſſador told him, if he attempted any ſearch there without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Orders from the Grand <hi>Signior,</hi> he ſhould have cauſe to repent it; at which he was ſo ſurpriz'd, that inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in that Enterpriſe, he made many Excuſes full of ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Council alſo choſe many Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in chief, and firſt Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> for Captain General, <hi>Dominico Mocenigo</hi> Proveditor General of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> General of the Infantry; Signior <hi>Aleſſandro Molino,</hi> and Signior <hi>Antonio Bembo</hi> Captains extraordinary of the Ships the Sieurs <hi>Pauli Michieli, Mathew

               <p>The <hi>Morlaques</hi> alſo for the greater part ſided with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and gave the <hi>Turks</hi> continual Alarms during the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and frequently carried off conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Booties. The <hi>Morlaques</hi> will ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be mentioned in this Hiſtory, that I think my ſelf obliged to give my Reader a more particular account of them, which here follows in the words of Monſieur <hi>Amelot de la Houſſaye.</hi> 
                  <q>They volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily put themſelves under the Protection of the Republique in the year 1647. being induced to it by the Perſwaſions of a Prieſt named <hi>Stephen Sorich,</hi> a man who knew as well to manage a Sword, as to carry the Crucifix. They haraſs'd the <hi>Turks</hi> by continual Incurſions, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away what they could, and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they could not carry away; and then retiring into the Mountains, where it was more difficult to find than overcome them, ſo well they knew the Bye-ways and narrow Paſſages of them. Beſides their deep reſentment of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31594:10"/>Maſſacre made upon ſome of theirs, in the Year 1647. at <hi>Knin,</hi> a Place of the <hi>Boſſina,</hi> by <hi>Tekieli</hi> Governour of that Province, and the barbarous Cruelty us'd towards <hi>Sorich,</hi> who was tortured to death in the Year 1648. the Intereſt of a Sequin, granted them by the Senate for every Head of a <hi>Turk,</hi> has ſo far engag'd them againſt thoſe Infidels, that they have loſt all hopes of ever making Peace with the Port. By theſe means is this brave Militia tied to the Service of the Republique, being otherwiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd a ſort of men as unconſtant in their humour, as their abode. They have no certain places of retreat, but build themſelves Cottages in the open Plains, ſhunning the Licentiouſneſs and Concourſe of Cities, which corrupt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Diſcipline. In the Year 1648. <hi>Cliſſa</hi> being ſurrendred to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> who know not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Capitulation, or military Faith, could not abſtain from aſſaulting the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Garriſon as they marched out, putting two hundred of them to the Sword; nor had one eſcaped, had not the <hi>Venetian</hi> Officers come in to hinder
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31594:10"/>the Slaughter.</q> It will appear by what follows, that the Conqueſts made in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> are for the moſt part to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> who were always employed in the moſt difficult Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>After moſt of the Commanders were gone with their Squadrons to the <hi>Levant,</hi> Generaliſſimo <hi>Moroſini</hi> put to Sea from the Coaſts of <hi>Italy</hi> on the 10th. of <hi>June,</hi> with five Galeaſſes, two Galleys, and ſixteen other Ships, and ſet ſail for <hi>Corfu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Campaigne was begun with the taking of the Iſle and Fortreſs of <hi>Santa Maura:</hi> This Iſle was formerly joyn'd to the Continent of <hi>Greece,</hi> and reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Weſtern Iſlands, as thoſe of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> among the Eaſtern: In effect, the whole breadth of <hi>Greece</hi> taken from Eaſt to Weſt, divides the <hi>Archipelago</hi> from <hi>Santa Maura;</hi> it was known to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients by the name of <hi>Leucas,</hi> and was part of the Kingdom of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and is very near <hi>Ithaca,</hi> where that Prince and his Wife <hi>Penelope</hi> did reſide. One of the Rocks of this Iſland ſerv'd formerly as the laſt Refuge for the unfortunate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31594:11"/>Lovers of <hi>Greece,</hi> who by leaping from the top of it, found a ſad, but ſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of their tormenting Paſſion. 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Sapho</hi> the famous Poeteſs, upon the news of her Lovers Falſhood, gave the firſt Example of that kind. Others attribute to <hi>Cephalus,</hi> the firſt Eſſay of ſo uncommon a Cure for Love. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Santa Maura,</hi> 'tis certain it has always been eſteem'd a place of great importance; it is adjoyning to <hi>Epirus,</hi> and is near the <hi>Morea,</hi> at the entrance of the Gulf of <hi>Lepante,</hi> where was fought that famous Battle in 1571. which won ſo much Glory to the Chriſtian Army, and <hi>Don John of Auſtria</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Santa Maura</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced under the obedience of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> by <hi>Benedetto Peſaro</hi> in the year 1502. This General, with a ſuccour of ſome Veſſels from the Pope, King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> landed part of his Army, and having, after an obſtinate Fight in which many <hi>Turks</hi> were ſlain, made himſelf Maſter of the Bridge, forc'd the City to ſubmit; but matters being ſoon after brought to an
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31594:11"/>accommodation between <hi>Bajazet</hi> II. and the Republick, by the mediation of <hi>Baſſa Achmet,</hi> it was agreed, that the Iſle of <hi>Santa Maura</hi> ſhould be reſtored to the <hi>Turks,</hi> which the <hi>Venetians</hi> the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſented to, on the account that that of <hi>Cephalone</hi> ſhould remain to them. The League which they made with the Emperor and King of <hi>Poland</hi> againſt the common Enemy of Chriſtendom, in the Year 1684. having oblig'd them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare War, they reſolv'd to attack <hi>Santa Maura</hi> after their General <hi>Moroſini</hi> had held a Council of War at <hi>Corſu</hi> the 15th. of <hi>July</hi> with the chief Commanders of the Squadrons, and principal Officers of the auxiliary Forces. But before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Reader with any further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Expedition, it will not be amiſs to ſhew him the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ships of War belonging to the ſeveral Potentates who had joyn'd their Intereſt with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> their number; and the order of Battle agreed on in caſe they had been forc'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Grand <hi>Signior</hi>'s Sea-forces, which is here laid down as it was prepared at <hi>Corfu,</hi> and confirm'd at <hi>Venice.</hi>

               <p>The attack of <hi>Santa Maura</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd on in the Council held at <hi>Corfu,</hi> where were preſent Proveditor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Cornaro,</hi> the chief Commanders of the ſeveral Squadrons ſent by the Pope, the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and the Order of <hi>Malta,</hi> General <hi>Strazoldo,</hi> and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers: Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> muſtred all his Forces deſign'd to be landed. Two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions, each conſiſting of ſix thouſand men, one being of the Pope's Forces, the other of <hi>Malta,</hi> muſtred together with eight thouſand out of other Companies. The firſt Line of this latter Battalion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with ſuch ſplendour as was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, being compos'd of a hundred Knights clad in their Coat-armours of red Sattin with the white Croſs of their Order. The Army ſet ſail the 19th. of <hi>July,</hi> and the day following arriv'd at little more than Cannon-ſhot diſtance from <hi>Santa Maura,</hi> and there caſt Anchor. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty extends it ſelf Eaſtward upon an <hi>Isthmus,</hi> or neck of Land, and is joyn'd to the Continent Northward, by an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queduct of three hundred and ſixty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in manner of a Bridge, not above three or four Foot in breadth: A wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31594:12"/>Bridge of three Partitions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a Paſſage to the Continent both on the Eaſt and Weſt ſide. It is a <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula</hi> of a conſiderable length; the head of it bears the name of <hi>St. John's Point.</hi> The Fortreſs in an irregular Pentagon, each corner is flanck'd with great Towers, and there are ſeveral ſmall ones along the Curtain.</p>
               <p>The Fleet being entred the Port of <hi>Demata,</hi> which is Eaſtward of the place, and is capable of receiving a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Veſſels, they landed ſome men. Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> alſo went on ſhoar, and viſited all the Poſts which they had taken view of, and a lodgment made by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Manetta,</hi> in a place call'd <hi>Chiebe,</hi> of which he had made himſelf Maſter, being a Houſe of Pleaſure belonging to the <hi>Aga</hi>'s Son: in the mean time he would not fire upon them till he had ſent to ſummon the Governour of the place; he ſet forth to him by writing the juſt cauſes the Republique had to raiſe a powerful Army, the <hi>Turks</hi> having vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the peace, by harbouring the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs</hi> of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and uſing hoſtilities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Subjects of that State.

               <p>The firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Batteries raz'd the Bulwark to the ground, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31594:13"/>widened the Breach, which before was conſiderable; they diſmounted four pieces of the Enemies Cannon, and the Bombs ſet fire to ſeveral parts of the Town. The Works being advanc'd by the help of continual firing from the Cannon and Mortar-pieces, the Beſiegers began to fill up the Ditch with Fagots and Sacks of Earth. At laſt, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 6th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> hung out the white Flag to give notice they would capitulate; and about one in the Night, they ſent three Deputies to Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> to let him know they were ready to ſurrender the place upon honourable Conditions; they demanded leave to march out with all their Goods, but no more was allow'd them than their Families, and what they could carry away on their Backs. The Hoſtages were ſent the day following, and all the Slaves ſet at liberty on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſerve on the Ships or Galleys of the Republique, in the quality of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Souldiers. The Garriſon being ſeven hundred men, march'd out towards the Evening with Sword and Muſquet; they were ſhip'd and carried on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shore of an Arm of the Sea. At
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31594:14"/>the ſame time the <hi>Venetians</hi> entred the Town at the Breach. The Booty given to the Souldiers was conſiderable; there was found great ſtore of Proviſion in the place, and Eighty pieces of Cannon. The <hi>Venetians</hi> loſt but 200 men in the ſiege. Monſieur <hi>Jouy</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> Serjeant-Major of the Army, and Colonel of a <hi>German</hi> Regiment, receiv'd a wound on his Thigh, and was ſhot through the Arm with a Muſquet-bullet. Signior <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſini</hi> immediately caus'd the principal Moſque to be bleſs'd, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> ſung in it; it was dedicated under the name <hi>St. Saviour,</hi> it being on the 6th. of <hi>August,</hi> the Feaſt-day of the Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord, that the <hi>Turks</hi> hung out the white Flag. Another Moſque was likewiſe bleſs'd and dedicated to St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan,</hi> upon whoſe Feaſt-day the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Forces entred the place; the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it was conferr'd upon Signior <hi>Lorenzo Venier,</hi> a noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador then in the Court of <hi>France:</hi> All of that name were eminent for their Services to the Republique. <hi>Sebastian Venier</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army,

               <p>General <hi>Moroſini</hi> after having repair'd the Fortifications of <hi>Santa Maura,</hi> caus'd the Mortars and Bombs to be brought thither, and all Proviſions and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the place might ſtand in need of, in caſe of a Siege, and choſe out two thouſand men, being all that were fit to march, many having been made uſeleſs by Diſeaſes and Fatigue, and ſome left for a Garriſon in <hi>Santa Maura.</hi> Colonel <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo della Decima</hi> was ſent to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Country to draw together all the <hi>Grecians</hi> he could to ſtrengthen his Army. Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> having ſet ſail, made for the Port of <hi>Petala,</hi> there to wait for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from the Colonel who was advanc'd about twenty ſix Miles from <hi>Santa Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> from thence to the Port of <hi>Drago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mette,</hi> where he caſt Anchor and landed his Army, which conſiſted of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Venetians,</hi> about one thouſand of the Pope's Auxiliaries, and fifteen or ſixteen hundred <hi>Greeks.</hi> This Army advanc'd on the Plains; and ſome Turkiſh Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons that were poſted in ſeveral places, and charg'd with the defence of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31594:15"/>retired without making much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. <hi>Saban Bacha,</hi> Governour of <hi>Preveza,</hi> had ſent out theſe Squadrons to obſerve the motions of the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and finding from their obſervations, no reaſon to believe they had any deſign on the place, he march'd out to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of them, with a deſign to draw the Chriſtians to fight and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them; but they having ſet fire to four or five Villages, return'd to Port <hi>Petala</hi> to reimbarque themſelves after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waſted the Country during the ſpace of five days. At the ſame time Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> with his Galleys got within view of <hi>Patras</hi> and <hi>Lepante,</hi> his deſign being to draw the <hi>Turks</hi> from that ſide, who, while the <hi>Venetians</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd on the flat Country, had reaſon to hope it would be eaſie to charge them. Next he came to the Port of <hi>Demata,</hi> where he call'd a Council of War, in which the Attack of <hi>Preveza</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd on. The Conqueſt of that place was the only means to ſecure <hi>Santa Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> ſo lately taken by the Republique, which otherwiſe lay much expos'd to the Infidels, and might eaſily be beſieg'd.</p>

Although the Advantages the <hi>Venetians</hi> obtain'd in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> were not very extraordinary, yet will it be requiſite to give ſome account of them, what they did there, being but a Prelude to their great deſigns upon the Infidels.</p>
               <p>The War began to kindle in <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> by the frequent Incurſions of both Parties; in one made by the Infidels to the very Cannon of <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> they carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſeven Priſoners, having ranſack'd ſome Villages, but the <hi>Morlaques</hi> hearing of it, put themſelves immediately on the purſuit; and having overtaken them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them not only to quit their Booty and Priſoners, but to ſeek their own
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31594:20"/>ſafety by flight; fifty of them were taken, and ſeveral kill'd or wounded.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Signior <hi>Antonio Zen,</hi> Proveditor extraordinary of <hi>Cattaro,</hi> came to <hi>Peraſto,</hi> his deſign being to forage round about <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> and hinder the Garriſon from gathering in their Harveſt, and having for this purpoſe drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a thouſand fighting men, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his march towards the place the 22d. of <hi>July,</hi> and executed his deſign with ſo god ſucceſs, that he not only ſet fire to all the Villages on the Eaſt ſide of it, but even to the Suburbs and lower Town of <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> conſiſting of above three hundred Houſes: He found there great ſtore of Wheat and other Corn which he ſeiz'd. The Fire laſted from Morning till Noon, though the <hi>Turks</hi> made ſeveral Sallies to quench it, and beat off the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who ſtill repuls'd them with ſuch vigour, as forc'd them back into the place. There were twenty <hi>Turks</hi> kill'd on the ſpot, and fifty wounded in theſe Sallies in which they charg'd ſeven times. The diſorder which is unavoidable on ſuch occaſions, was the cauſe that fifty <hi>Turks</hi> were involv'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31594:20"/>in the Flames, and ſeven others fell into the hands of the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> who took them away Priſoners, with good ſtore of Cattel, part of which was taken in the Suburbs, the Garriſon not having time, in ſo great a Surpriſe, to ſecure them. To compleat the happineſs to this day, the Proveditor General commanded one Galley and four other light Veſſels to purſue three Fuiſts of <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> which by the report of the Priſoners, were ſet to Sea as Pyrates: that Evening they met a Galeot of <hi>Dulcigno,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Solyman Aga,</hi> the famous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſair of that place, who having kend the <hi>Venetian</hi> Veſſels, endeavour'd to gain the ſhore, which he could not do with that ſpeed, but two and twenty men were kill'd, and himſelf in the number. There were found in the Galeot two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chriſtians whom this Corſair was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into Slavery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sieur Valier,</hi> General of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> made himſelf Maſter of the Caſtles of <hi>Sym</hi> and <hi>Narenta</hi> about the end of this year.

Theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> took courage from the fame of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Conqueſts, they drew together in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31594:22"/>a body, and began to exerciſe their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities with doubtful ſucceſſes. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſent ſome Forces from <hi>Braccio di Maina</hi> to bring them to their Duty, who ſoon overtook, attack'd and routed them, and continued the purſuit of them, being ſeconded by other Forces led on by a certain <hi>Bacha:</hi> But the <hi>Greeks</hi> back'd by unexpected Succours, and the preſence of Signior <hi>Delfino,</hi> rally'd and charg'd with ſo much vigour, that of 3500. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, there eſcaped but 140. and of 130. men out of a Company of <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> all but two ſuffered the ſame fate.</p>
               <p>The deep reſentment the <hi>Greeks</hi> had of the Maſſacre of Abbot <hi>Giona,</hi> whom the Infidels took in a Monaſtery ſituate near the Gulf of <hi>Preveza,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards publickly empal'd, fomented their Revolt, and engag'd them ſo far, that they breath'd nothing but Revenge, and declar'd themſelves open Enemies of the Port.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Heydukes,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Montenegro</hi> came to blows with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſeveral were kill'd and wounded on both ſides; after that the <hi>Morlaques</hi> made an Incurſion, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31594:22"/>advanc'd towards <hi>Sing,</hi> and carried off ſtore of Cattel, and ſome Priſoners, amongſt whom one call'd <hi>Papurſinovich Aga,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon the Field Five thouſand Crowns, and ſeven Horſes of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for his Ranſom.

               </p>
               <p>In the mean time General <hi>Paulo Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> having drawn up a thouſand Horſe and ſome Foot, put himſelf at the head of three thouſand <hi>Morlaques</hi> that were joyn'd in a Body under their Leader: Theſe Forces made Incurſions into the Country to curb the <hi>Turks.</hi> In effect, the <hi>Bacha</hi> of <hi>Boſſine,</hi> who was march'd towards <hi>Hungary,</hi> was oblig'd to turn back towards <hi>Clin</hi> with ſeven thouſand men under his command. Signior <hi>Michiel</hi> encamp'd his men in ſuch order upon the Frontiers of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> that he was ſtill in a poſture of defence; which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution gave the People of thoſe parts a favourable opportunity of gathering in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31594:23"/>their Harveſt with ſafety, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd the <hi>Morlaques</hi> to make Incurſions in Parties, and ranſack the Turkiſh Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. In the mean time the Fuiſts of <hi>Dulcigno</hi> took Sixty Fiſhermen near <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zole;</hi> and four Galleys of <hi>Malta</hi> ſailing towards the Naval Army commanded by Generaliſſimo <hi>Moroſini,</hi> met on their way a man of War of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> which after an obſtinate Fight they took, and made three hundred <hi>Turks</hi> Priſoners, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd many Chriſtians from Slavery.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Morlaques</hi> thwarted all the attempts of the Infidels in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> yet they drew up in the beginning of <hi>June</hi> to the number of eight thouſand men, and laid ſiege to the Fortreſs of <hi>Duare.</hi> The Courage and Reſolution of the beſieged gave oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to General <hi>Valier,</hi> and Sieur <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> General of the Cavalry of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to come to their relief. Theſe two Generals made it their endeavour, each on their ſide to break through the lines of the Beſiegers, and took their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſo exactly for drawing together the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces under their Command, that marching with great expedition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31594:23"/>the Infidels, they attack'd them in three ſeveral places, and ſoon put them into diſorder. In leſs than an hour's time the <hi>Turks</hi> found themſelves oblig'd to raiſe the Siege with the loſs of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men that were cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſeventy made Priſoners, of which number were forty Officers and one Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Aga.</hi> The Booty that day was very conſiderable, they took one great piece of Cannon and two ſmall ones, three Mortar-pieces, one Petard, fourteen Colours, and a Convoy of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion newly brought to their Camp, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the greateſt part of their Baggage. In this action there were but ſix Chriſtian Souldiers kill'd, and thirty wounded: The Enemy in his flight was purſued by the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Baſha</hi> of <hi>Boſſina,</hi> who was but four Leagues diſtant, had upon the firſt noiſe of the Fight, march'd to their relief with four thouſand Horſe, they were defeated before he could come up, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> encourag'd with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, charg'd him ſo vigorouſly, that they forc'd him to fly as the others had done. The Booty and Priſoners were given to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31594:24"/>the Souldiers for a reward of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Nine hundred perſons towards <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> to free themſelves from their Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under <hi>Mahmut Aga Haradanovich,</hi> ſubmitted themſelves to the Republick; and General <hi>Michiel</hi> aſſign'd them Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for their ſafe retreat. Yet the <hi>Baſha</hi> of <hi>Boſſina</hi> would have made an attempt to repair his misfortune, had he not been inform'd that Chevalier <hi>Janco</hi> cover'd the Fortreſs before mention'd with four thouſand <hi>Morlaques:</hi> He alſo ſoon after advanc'd into the Country of the <hi>Turks</hi> with three thouſand and five hundred <hi>Morlaques,</hi> and meeting five hundred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, put them to flight, having kill'd one hundred and fifty, beſides thoſe that were drown'd in the River <hi>Narenta,</hi> thinking to ſave themſelves at <hi>Gabella.</hi> In this action he made an hundred Priſoners, took a great Booty, and ſent ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to <hi>Venice,</hi> as a Mark of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>The Naval Army under the Conduct of Generaliſſimo <hi>Moroſini,</hi> came near the Coaſt of the <hi>Morea,</hi> where they began the Campaigne with the Siege of <hi>Coron,</hi> the particulars of which are to be ſeen

               <p>The Squadron of <hi>Malta</hi> conſisting of eight Galleys, and commanded by Signior <hi>Brancaccio,</hi> joyn'd it ſelf in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> with the Pope's Squadron of five Galleys, which bearing no Flag, put it ſelf under the command of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Malta.</hi> About the middle of <hi>June</hi> they arriv'd together at Port <hi>Dragomet,</hi> where the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet was, to which ſome days before, were joyn'd four of the Great Duke's Galleys; and after they had ſo regulated matters, that according to cuſtome the Captain General of <hi>Malta</hi> was plac'd on the right hand of the

The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence which Captain General <hi>Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini</hi> had held for ſome Months with the <hi>Mainotts</hi> to encourage them to ſhake off the Turkiſh Yoke, made him believe, that he might by their means make good Progreſs in the <hi>Morea;</hi> but having heard as he came near their Coaſts, that they had met with ill ſucceſs in the Attempt they had made to procure their liberty, and that they had been forc'd to give Hoſtages to the <hi>Turks</hi> for aſſurance of their Fidelity, he found himſelf oblig'd to take other meaſures before he could attempt any conſiderable Enterpriſe. His firſt deſign was to attack <hi>Modon,</hi> the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City of the <hi>Morea;</hi> but having viewed the ſituation the 23d. of <hi>June,</hi> there appeared ſo many difficulties as to the landing his men and Cannon, as made
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31594:25"/>him alter his deſign, and reſolve on the Siege of <hi>Coron.</hi> This place call'd by the Ancients <hi>Corona,</hi> is by Land about twelve Miles diſtant from <hi>Modon,</hi> and ſituate beyond the Cape <hi>Gallo</hi> towards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Mainotts.</hi> It is a Town of good Trade by reaſon of its ſituation; it has a Haven fit to receive a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of Veſſels; it has the Sea on one ſide, and on the ſide towards the Land, it has a Wall fortify'd wth ſix Towers of an Antick Faſhion. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> inhabit the lower Town, and the <hi>Turks</hi> dwell in the Caſtle, which makes the upper Town. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were Maſters of it in the fifteenth Age: <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Turkiſh Emperor took it from them, as alſo the Town of <hi>Modon,</hi> in 1499. Prince <hi>Doria</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who commanded the Spaniſh Fleet, retook it from the <hi>Turks</hi> in 1533<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and leſt in it as Governour <hi>Mendoz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The 25th, in the Morning the Forces were landed almoſt within Cannon-ſhot
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31594:26"/>of the City without any oppoſition from the <hi>Turks;</hi> they conſiſted of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Venetians,</hi> a thouſand <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> two thouſand and four hundred of thoſe that were ſent by the Prince of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> Duke of <hi>Hanover,</hi> with the young Prince his Son, according to the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with the Republique; the Battalion of <hi>Malta</hi> conſiſting of eight or nine hundred Souldiers and twenty ſix Knights, one Battalion of the Pope's of four hundred men, and another of the Great Duke's, of three hundred, which made up in all about eight thouſand Foot without the Cavalry. This Army was commanded by the Count St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of great ability and experience, who had long time ſerv'd the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Neubourg.</hi> The firſt Poſt in order of Battel, was taken by the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> the Commander of which, Monſieur <hi>de la Tour Maubourg,</hi> had the general Command, with as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal an Approbation, as he had on the like occaſion at the Siege of <hi>Candia:</hi> He had alſo under his Command the Batalion of the Pope's Galleys. All this neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs paſs'd as well in the Camp as the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31594:26"/>Fleet, under the Orders and Direction of Captain General <hi>Moroſini,</hi> and Signior <hi>Brancaccio</hi> General of the Galleys of <hi>Malta,</hi> which lay at Anchor near the Coaſt.</p>
               <p>The approach'd the City under the ſhelter of Olive-trees, and nothing paſs'd but ſome light Skirmiſhes: On the 26th. they open'd the Trenches, the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and the Pope's on the right hand towards the Sea, the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Sclavonians</hi> on the left towards a Suburb or out-Town, of which they made themſelves Maſters without oppoſition. The ſame day we loſt Chevalier <hi>San Vitali</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was kill'd in the Trenches by a Muſquet-ſhot. The Works went forward without much interruption, and they rais'd two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries each of three great pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, with four Mortars for Bombs, to which they added afterwards two pieces of Cannon. The Enemy made but light Sallies in which they were vigorouſly repuls'd; their firing was moderate, and gave us cauſe to believe, that they were not in a poſture to hold out long. But it appear'd by the conſequence, that their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31594:27"/>Intention was to nouriſh in the minds of their men, the hopes of a ſpeedy aſſiſtance from the <hi>Baſha</hi> of the <hi>Morea,</hi> who had drawn together a flying Army of three or four thouſand men, both Horſe and Foot, which oblig'd ours to labour hard at their Works, for their ſhelter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and to fortifie a certain eminence of Ground which on one ſide command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Lines, and on the other, laid open the Country about. Here we rais'd a Battery of four pieces of Cannon, and one Mortar-piece.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſha</hi> of the <hi>Morea</hi> appear'd in effect, on the 3d. of <hi>July,</hi> and encamp'd within Cannon-ſhot of the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; where having retrench'd himſelf, he mounted on a Battery four pieces of Cannon, which playing croſs-wiſe with the Artillery of the place, did much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode our Works. This <hi>Baſha</hi> gave us an Alarm every day by ſome warm Skirmiſhes, in which, nevertheleſs, the <hi>Turks</hi> were always repuls'd with loſs. The beſieged on their part redoubled their fire, and anſwered haughtily to the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons we ſent them, threatning them to ſet fire to the Mines at which ours did
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31594:27"/>work continually, but with leſs ſucceſs than might have been wiſh'd, being forc'd to bring them through a Rock, which ſort of Works took up no leſs than three Weeks time.</p>
               <p>The Fortifications of the place were much ruin'd by our Batteries, and the Bombs had made great Deſtruction; but beſides that, it had an advantageous ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, having but one Front to guard, which was flank'd with great Towers built on the Rock; it was further defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eighty piece of Cannon, and ſtore of Ammunition, and Proviſions of all ſort, and ſeven or eight hundred men in Garriſon, beſides others fit to bear Arms in ſo great a number as four or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls; ſo that we could have no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Town, but by means of the Ovens of our Mines, and vigorous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, during which we were ſure to be attack'd by the flying Army of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This poſture of Affairs caus'd us ſome trouble, but at laſt the Mines being ready to be ſprung, on the 24th. of <hi>July</hi> it was reſolv'd to make an Attempt, and all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were made for it. Chevalier

                  <hi>Segres</hi> was to begin the Aſſault at the head of Sixty Granadiers back'd by a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fuſeliers and <hi>Sclavonians.</hi> Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de la Barre,</hi> Lieutenant General of the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> follow'd Chevalier <hi>de Refuge,</hi> the firſt Captain, at the head of a Party of our Forces, and ſome of the Pope's and <hi>Venetians;</hi> he was back'd by the Prince of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty of his men, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de la Tour Maubourg</hi> follow'd with a Body of the Knights, in the midſt of whom was the Standard of the Order; he had alſo with him ſome of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and ſome of the Pope's; but when every one had taken his Poſt, it happen'd that the Mine was not ſtrong enough to blow up the Rock, ſo that it had not the Effect that was requiſite to make way for the Aſſault intended.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time that fire was ſet to the Mine, the <hi>Baſha</hi> of the <hi>Morea</hi> attack'd the Redout and Battery we had rais'd on the Eminence that ſecur'd our Lines, with ſo much vigour, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Sclavonians</hi> who had the defence of it, though always accuſtom'd to behave themſelves bravely, could not reſiſt him,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31594:28"/>ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſoon made themſelves Maſters of the Redout, and had already planted on it more than twenty of their Standards, when the News of this Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was brought to Monſieur <hi>de la Tour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears by the Poſture of the Forces commanded to the Aſſault, that he with his Knights was neareſt to this Poſt of ſo great importance for the ſafety of the whole Army: He ſaw the Loſs was not to be retriev'd but by ſome extraordinary Action, and therefore he undertook it without delay. He call'd upon his men to follow him, and having kiſs'd the Croſs of our Standard, with that ſenſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion which gave life to all his Actions, he advanc'd with eager haſte towards the Enemy, was the firſt man that leap'd into the Redout, and there with his own hand ſlew two <hi>Turks</hi> that oppos'd him, a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Servant at Arms <hi>Michon</hi> coming up courageouſly to the defence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander <hi>de la Tour</hi> was kill'd by a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot. The Chevalier <hi>de Grandmont</hi> receiv'd two Wounds with a Sable and one Muſquet-ſhot. The Chevaliers <hi>de Bourgon</hi> and <hi>de Gaillard,</hi> and Brother-Servant at Arms <hi>de la Motte,</hi> were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded, the Chevaliers <hi>Pioſaſque</hi> and <hi>Doria Braſſeuze</hi> but ſlightly; and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Pont,</hi> who carried the Standard, having been aſſaulted by two <hi>Turks,</hi> kill'd one with his Piſtol, the other with his Sword, being himſelf but lightly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Chevalier <hi>de Beaupre Choiſeul</hi> was one of the firſt that caſt themſelves into the Redout, Chevalier <hi>Mechatin,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of the Battalion, ſignaliz'd himſelf in the ſame manner; and in fine, all of them ſhew'd ſuch courage, that they drove the Enemy from that Poſt, took eleven of their Banners, and planted there the Standard of the Order; at the ſight of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31594:29"/>which, the whole Army crying out, <hi>Vive Malta,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Sclavonians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed their wonted Courage, and kill'd three hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> ſo that none eſcaped that had lodg'd themſelves in the Redout. This days Work coſt the Chriſtians an hundred and fifty men.</p>
               <p>The whole Camp acknowledg'd the Knights for their Deliverers, and extoll'd them to the Skies. The General Officers ſent a Complement to the General of the Galleys of <hi>Malta;</hi> and indeed nothing would have been wanting to have made it the greateſt, and moſt glorious Action that has been heard of, had it not coſt the lives of ſo many brave men, and in particular of <hi>Commandant de la Tour,</hi> who was lamented by the whole Army, and whoſe Death Captain General <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſini</hi> could not hear of without weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He was interr'd with all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that might ſerve to give teſtimony of the eſteem they had for his merit; his Heart was preſerv'd to be carry'd to <hi>Malta,</hi> with his Bones. It may be ſaid of him, That his mind was compos'd of ſo many noble Qualities as ſcarce ever met in any other. His Piety was ſo exemplar,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31594:30"/>that the good Effects it produc'd on thoſe that ſerv'd under him, can hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd: The ſweetneſs of his temper, his modeſt and engaging Carriage, his Wit, his Courage, and all his other Vertues, made him ſo agreeable to all, that the loſs of him could not but be generally lamented. But ſince, according to his commendable cuſtom, he communicated before he went to the Battel, we doubt not but the Sacrifice of his Life joyn'd with ſo Chriſtian-like a Preparation, rais'd him to the ſtate of everlaſting Glory and Happineſs in the other World. The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de la Barre,</hi> who always obſerv'd the ſame Foot-ſteps, was preferr'd to the general Command of the Battalion, and the eſteem which all the World has for his merit, gives us no ſmall ſatisfaction after ſo great a loſs.</p>
               <p>The 30th. of <hi>July</hi> the Enemy made a freſh attempt upon our Lines, and ſome of them with their Swords in their hands, caſt themſelves into the Redout, ſituate on the Eminence to which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had now given the name of <hi>St. John's Fort,</hi> as having been preſerv'd by the the Valour of thoſe Knights; but the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31594:30"/>Infidels were beat back to their very Trenches by the Pope's Forces, and thoſe of the Republique; and they met with the like reſiſtance in divers other Aſſaults, in which thoſe of <hi>Malta</hi> had frequently the good Fortune to ſee them fly as ſoon as the Standard of St. <hi>John</hi> appear'd; the Barbarians exclaiming with loud Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries according to their cuſtom in Battel, That <hi>were it not for this Battalion of</hi> Malta, they ſhould ſoon bring their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to effect.</p>
               <p>The beſieged in the mean time defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with great obſtinacy, tho' the Breach were very conſiderable on the ſide of the Attack where thoſe of <hi>Malta</hi> were plac'd, and toward the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Attack there was prepared a Mine of two hundred Barrels of Powder, the effect of which was expected to be very great. Our men waited with impatience the day of aſſault; but it being certain that the <hi>Turks</hi> of the Country who were grown to the number of ſix thouſand men, would not fail to attack our Lines at the ſame time we mounted the Breach, it was reſolv'd to prevent them by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking them in their own Works, which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31594:31"/>was put in execution with all the Succeſs imaginable on the ſeventh day of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Our Forces having march'd out of their Lines in good order, the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were poſſeſs'd with fear, fell into ſuch Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they ſuffer'd themſelves to be cut to pieces without much reſiſtance; we gain'd their Retrenchments, and made our ſelves Maſters of their Batterie of four pieces of Cannon; we took from them a conſiderable number of Horſes, and drove them far into the Country, with the loſs of no more than two or three Souldiers of all our Forces, and not one of the Battalion of <hi>Malta:</hi> we kill'd a thouſand of their men. An Action ſo extraordinary was with reaſon look'd upon as a ſtroke of God's Providence, and the Veneration the whole Army had for the Piety and Devotion of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Commander <hi>de la Tour Maubourg,</hi> made it be believ'd and ſaid amongſt them, That without doubt it ought to be attributed to his Prayers. A Bark that arrived here ſince from <hi>Patras</hi> in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> reported that ſome <hi>Turks</hi> that eſcap'd from the Fight, repreſented the Defeat much greater than we knew, and that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31594:31"/>they affirm'd the <hi>Baſha</hi> of the <hi>Morea</hi> was there kill'd, and his Army wholly diſpers'd.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this Victory General <hi>Moroſini</hi> ſent Summons to the beſieged, but they made anſwer haughtily, That they knew their Friends had been beaten, yet that they nevertheleſs were reſolv'd to die rather than ſurrender, which made us think of preparing the Mine for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſault.</p>
               <p>The 11th. of <hi>August</hi> was the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it, and the Forces having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Poſts in the Night, about break of day the great Mine of the <hi>Venetians</hi> Attack was ſprung, and had the Effect that was expected, and had given them an opportunity to enter the City at that time, had they not, inſtead of improving it, contented themſelves with making a Lodgment on the Breach. In the mean while as ſoon as the noiſe of the Mine was heard, they Forces of <hi>Malta</hi> who were at the head of the other Attack, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the Pope's, and thoſe of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> with great vigour gain'd the top of the Breach which had been ſome days open, though it was of very difficult ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but the Enemies having had time to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31594:32"/>fortifie themſelves there, there grew a furious Combat, during which the Knights did all that could be expected from their valour, to force the Retrenchment; but it being well flank'd and furniſh'd with Cannon and Artillery, they fir'd ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly upon them, that four of them were kill'd in the place, together with <hi>Compte de Fenelon,</hi> who ſerv'd with them in quality of a Volunteer, and more than thirty wounded. <hi>Chevalier de la Barre</hi> Commandant General of the Battalion, ſhew'd all the Courage imaginable on this laſt occaſion; he was well ſeconded by the Pope's Officers, and thoſe of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> of whom ſeveral were kill'd or wounded; but at laſt ſeeing it impoſſible to ſurmount thoſe vaſt difficulties, they were conſtrain'd to retire.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs this was ſo far from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning the Knights, that, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how great a Breach the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> Mine had made, they reſolv'd to give a freſh aſſault in the Afternoon at two places, but more furiouſly at the laſt Breach than the other. Every thing was prepar'd for it, when the <hi>Turks</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the deſign, on a ſudden hung out
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31594:32"/>a white Flag, and deſir'd to capitulate. Four of them advanc'd to the Breach, and propos'd to render themſelves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they might have their lives and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: But Captain General <hi>Moroſini</hi> not willing to conſent to any thing unleſs the Tower that made ſure the entrance into the City, were firſt put into our hands; it happen'd unluckily while this was in treaty, that two Chriſtian Souldiers quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling near the place, a Piſtol was ſhot off, and the Bandelier of another took fire at the ſame time. The <hi>Turks</hi> of the City upon that believing the Truce was broke, and that they were not ſincerely dealt with, fired a Cannon which kill'd ſeveral of ours: This was enough to make us reſume our Arms. The Chriſtians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cry'd out <hi>Treaſon,</hi> ſo briskly forc'd that little of a Retrenchment the Enemies had on the Breach, that nothing could hinder them from ruſhing into the City, where all were put to the Sword, except ſome few happy Men, and many Women and Children; Chevalier <hi>de la Barre</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had much difficulty to ſecure from the rage of the Souldiers, thoſe four <hi>Turks</hi> which came to parly with him.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31594:33"/>The Mine had buried under its Ruins the Governour of the place, a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Reſolution, which happen'd well for the Chriſtians, who otherwiſe would not ſo eaſily have made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the Siege of <hi>Coron</hi> ſeven and forty days after the Trenches were open'd, during which time the Chriſtian Army had two powerful Enemies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, over whom they gain'd a double Victory with all the Glory imaginable. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> with Count <hi>St. Paul,</hi> got much Honour. The young Count of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> with his Forces, ſignaliz'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a particular manner. Thoſe of <hi>Florence</hi> gave good Proofs of their Valour to the time of their reimbarking, which was ſome days before the end of the Siege. It is eaſie to judge how great a ſhare of Honour is due to the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> and the Pope's Forces who were always joyn'd with them. Chevalier <hi>de la Barre</hi> by many brave Actions maintain'd the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Sieur <hi>de la Tour</hi> had got. All the Knights generouſly ſacrific'd themſelves to the ſupport of the Faith, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon incredible Fatigues, and many of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31594:33"/>them ſhed their Blood, as may be ſeen in the Liſt at the end of the Book, in which I have ſet down their reſpective Nations.</p>
               <p>Let us now paſs to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> where though nothing happen'd of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as in the <hi>Morea,</hi> yet it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inform the Reader of what paſs'd worthy of remark in the Rencounters the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces had with the <hi>Turks</hi> in that Country and elſewhere. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to beſiege the Fortreſs of <hi>Sing;</hi> and in proſecution of this deſign, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals march'd at the head of their Forces, and immediately inveſted it. The Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were open'd, a Battery rais'd, and ſome Cannon mounted in ſpight of the Infidels who continually fired upon them: They ſummon'd the beſieged, who being well ſtored with Men and Proviſions, ſcorn'd the Conditions of Surrender which were offer'd, and by their vigorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance oblig'd us to quit the Attempt, ſome days after the opening our Trenches.</p>

The Garriſon which was numerous, conſiſting of ſix hundred men, was embark'd and guarded by a Convoy within a ſmall diſtance from <hi>Calamata:</hi> But the <hi>Aga</hi> fearing the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> inflicts on the unfortunate, remain'd among the <hi>Venetians:</hi> The Captain General gave him a Penſion of thirty Royals a Month after he had receiv'd Baptiſm with twenty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Turks.</hi> There were found in this place fifty one pieces of Cannon, two hundred Quintals of Powder, great ſtore of Bullet, with other Ammunition and Proviſion. Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> having thus gain'd the Town, put in a Garriſon of two hundred and fifty Foot Souldiers,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31594:35"/>under the command of the noble <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Bartholomeo Contareni,</hi> and <hi>Angelo Emo;</hi> and upon the advice he had, that the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> was advanc'd with ten thouſand men to lie before <hi>Calamata,</hi> he order'd the <hi>Saxons</hi> to be ſet on ſhoar to joyn the Army, which having advanc'd on the 12th. of <hi>September</hi> in Battel-array, to certain places where the Enemies were advantageouſly poſted, to diſpute the Paſſage, there happen'd ſome light Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes betwixt the Advance-guards: But whilſt all things were preparing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to come to a ſet-Battel the next day, the Infidels decamp'd before day to retire under the Cannon of <hi>Calamata,</hi> which is ſituate upon the declining of a Hill on the ſide of the River <hi>Spinazza,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> and has no other defence but a Caſtle built after the modern way, that can ſecure it from the Aſſaults of an Enemy. The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> ſurpriz'd this Fortreſs in the Year 1659. and quitted it after they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the Proviſion which they found there in abundance.</p>

The Dragoons commanded by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Courbon,</hi> and thoſe of Count <hi>Bernabo Viſconti</hi> who immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, having poſted themſelves in an advantageous place to bear the firſt Onſet of the Enemies, gave time to the Forces that follow'd them to paſs the narrow way. The <hi>Turks</hi> who might have taken advantage of this motion, made no At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack; and Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> ſet his Forces in order of Battel, and plac'd two ſmall pieces of Artillery on an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of ground from whence they fir'd continually on the <hi>Turks,</hi> who ſeeing the Dragoons march proudly towards them, thought to hem them in with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeveral Squadrons. But the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons not only bore the Onſet with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31594:44"/>great courage, but alighting from their Horſes, made the Infidels give way, and purſued them ſo ſucceſsfully, that they diſpers'd them; after which they bore ſo hard upon the Infantry, that they put them into diſorder, which was encreas'd by the Forces that march'd after the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons. The Fight laſted two hours, and ended with the flight of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who loſt above five hundred men in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had many wounded. There had been ſeveral that had rallied upon the occaſion of two or three thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> that were got together from ſeveral parts of the <hi>Morea,</hi> to reinforce the Seraſquier's Army, and were come near the field of Battel; but it was in vain they renew'd the Charge, they were again put to flight, and forc'd to leave their Baggage and Tents. There were but very few Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers either kill'd or wounded on the Chriſtian ſide. Prince <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> encouraged his Forces by his Example, and ſhew'd at the head of them all the Courage a man could be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Many other Voluntiers of great quality ſignaliz'd themſelves in the like manner on this occaſion. This Defeat
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31594:45"/>of which the beſieged could not doubt, when they ſaw the Heads of the <hi>Turks</hi> kill'd in the Battel, and the Colours the <hi>Venetians</hi> brought away, made ſo general a Conſternation in the City, that they loſt all hope of being reliev'd; and after ſome Conteſts, came to a Capitulation. It was permitted them to march out of <hi>Navarin</hi> with Arms and Baggage to be tranſported to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated the Articles of Capitulation in the Name of the Generaliſſimo: While they were regulating that Article that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the embarking the Garriſon, there happen'd a diſaſter that was like to have caus'd great Confuſion: A Magazine of Powder took fire, and was blown up in a moment, an hundred and fifty <hi>Turks</hi> were either burnt or buried in the ruines, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſix Chriſtians; the Governour was of the number; fifteen more were blown up and thrown from the place. It was preſently ſaid the <hi>Turks</hi> had prepared this Oven on purpoſe to deſtroy all the Chriſtians they could draw that way. This was enough to make them put all to the Sword, had not the Generaliſſimo appeas'd the Souldiers. He receiv'd the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31594:45"/>excuſes of the principal men of the place, who, when they brought him the Keys of the Town, and their Standards, ask'd permiſſion to juſtifie themſelves upon this Accident. It was found, in effect, that the Fire which was ſet to ſeveral Houſes by the Bombs, being kept alive under the Ruines, had made its way to this Magazine only by the negligence of the Officers, whom the unhappy ſtate of their Affairs had hindred to provide againſt ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. The Garriſon conſiſted of a thouſand Souldiers who embark'd with two thouſand other <hi>Turks,</hi> to paſs for <hi>Alexandria.</hi> On the 18th. of <hi>June</hi> Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>Moroſini</hi> entred the Town with Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> and the chief Officers of the Army, and the principal Moſque was made choice of to give God thanks in for this Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Chriſtian Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers met with the Turkiſh Caravan coming from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The number of the Enemies Ships did not diſmay them; they charg'd very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, and after they had either taken, or diſabled the Men of War which were their Convoy, they took the Caravan.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31594:46"/>The Ship called <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd alſo a Turkiſh Veſſel of Eighty pieces of Cannon; for having diſcover'd it afar off, they hung out Turkiſh Colours, and made up cloſe to her, with a deſign to board her, and quickly made themſelves Maſters of her before the Infidels could come to themſelves, or prepare for Fight. Two Turkiſh Galleots had the ſame chance meeting the famous Corſair <hi>Manetta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Morlaques</hi> made many Incurſions into the Enemies Territories, and amongſt others, thoſe of <hi>Sebenico</hi> and <hi>Traci</hi> being ſent for that purpoſe, to the number of twelve hundred, foraging in the open Country, ſurpriz'd a Town called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pana,</hi> and return'd with ſtore of Slaves and Cattel, having ranſack'd, and after ſet fire to the Houſes. In the mean time the <hi>Turks</hi> attempted no great matters in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> their greateſt Efforts being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the pillaging and burning ſome Villages between <hi>Cliſſa</hi> and <hi>Spalatro,</hi> for which purpoſe they had detach'd four thouſand Horſe: But an accident hapned, which fruſtrated their hopes of enjoying the Prey; for as they return'd with a great Booty, they fell into an Ambuſcade which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31594:46"/>four hundred <hi>Morlaques</hi> had laid for them in a narrow way, which terminates at a ſteep unpaſſable Mountain, from whence ſixty Peaſants, who had quitted their Houſes at the approach of the <hi>Turks,</hi> rowl'd down Stones of a prodigious bigneſs upon them who were ſtreightned in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Thus the <hi>Morlaques</hi> having robb'd the Enemy of his Booty, and delivered the Slaves, return'd victorious with about two hundred Priſoners. Let us now turn our Diſcourſe to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Camp in the <hi>Morea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conqueſt of the two <hi>Navarins</hi> was follow'd by the taking of <hi>Modon,</hi> a Town ſituate in the Province of <hi>Belveder,</hi> at one end of the <hi>Morea;</hi> it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd <hi>Methona.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> having aſſiſted at the taking of <hi>Conſtantinaple,</hi> in the year 1204. <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Earl of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> afterwards choſen Emperor of the Eaſt, gave them as a Recompence for the ſhare they had in the dangers of the Siege. the Iſle of <hi>Candia,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Modon,</hi> and <hi>Coron</hi> in the <hi>Morea,</hi> and that of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo</hi> in <hi>Albania,</hi> with the Iſle of <hi>Corfu;</hi> this Iſle was then in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> who had for their Captain
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31594:47"/>the famous Corſair <hi>Veterano.</hi> The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſet ſail the year following toward <hi>Corfu</hi> with thirty Galleys, and having met <hi>Veterano</hi> coming out of the Gulf, they attack'd him ſo ſucceſsfully, that having taken ſeven of his Galleys, they gave an entire Defeat to the reſt; after which, without any difficulty, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Corfu,</hi> and ſoon after of <hi>Modon</hi> and <hi>Coron. Modon</hi> remain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Dominion till the year 1500. when <hi>Bajazet</hi> the ſecond, Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> attack'd it by Sea and Land with an Army of 140000. men, and above 220. Sail of Ships. They made a vigorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but the Proveditor <hi>Contarini</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt the beſieged ſhould yield the place for fear of not being relieved, choſe five of his beſt Galleys, and having laden them with Ammunition and Proviſions, which he knew they wanted, ſent them to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> Four of them got happily into the Port, but that which was intended for the ſafety of the Town, prov'd the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its loſs. The beſieged were ſo overjoy'd at this relief, that to ſee it come in, they quitted the defence of their Walls. The <hi>Turks</hi> took advantage of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31594:47"/>their Imprudence, and there being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſome Breaches made, they mounted them, and found but a ſmall number of Souldiers to guard them, whom they ſoon cut to pieces. The Forces that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in the Galleys, would have made head againſt them, but they beat down all before them, and almoſt the whole City was fill'd with deſtruction by Fire and Sword; they neither ſpared the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor the other Officers, and ſtruck off the Head of <hi>Andrea Falconi</hi> Biſhop of the place, who came in his Pontifical Habit to encourage the Inhabitants to their own defence.</p>
               <p>Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> being come before this place with part of his Forces on the 21ſt. of <hi>June</hi> in the Evening, the next day he view'd the Haven, and obſerv'd the places proper for landing the reſt of his Army. This Debarkment was made in very good order, the Infidels not uſing any great endeavours to oppoſe them. The other Forces had made one day's March by Land, ſince the taking of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varin,</hi> and arriv'd on the 22d. before <hi>Modon:</hi> This Town is ſituate upon a neck of Land that ſhoots it ſelf into the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31594:48"/>Sea; it is fortify'd with a Wall of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone fill'd on the inſide with Earth; on the ſide towards the Land, it is ſhelter'd by a Baſtion not joined to the Walls, and another rais'd Work all ſurrounded by a good Ditch Paliſado'd. Count <hi>Conings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> immediately gave order for the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation, which was eaſie by reaſon of the deep Waters that are round the place. The 23d. they wrought on the Trenches, and on the 24th. they got Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots in the Camp it ſelf, which lay croſs a Grove of Orange-trees, of which Wood they made 100000. The 25th. they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with eight Mortar-pieces to caſt their Bombs; they threw five hundred, of which eighty miſs'd the Town, and thirty broke in the Air. The 26th.

The firſt of <hi>July</hi> the Forces of <hi>Malta</hi> open'd their Trenches, and carried on their Works two hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; on the 2d. the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reliev'd the Trenches, and Generaliſſimo <hi>Moroſini</hi> ſummon'd the Town again; the <hi>Turks</hi> came to capitulate; the Governour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, That if they would give him two thouſand Sequins he would perſwade the Garriſon to ſurrender, and urg'd that a Truce would be requiſite to ſummon the Council; the Truce was granted on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Works might continue on

Count <hi>Coningsmark,</hi> beſides the Workmen, had under his command five hundred <hi>Germans,</hi> by whoſe help they carried on their Works within thirty paces of the Counterſcarp, with a Line of Communication of fifty paces, and a place of Parade on each ſide. On the 3d. the <hi>Diſdar</hi> broke the Truce, alledging that he could not perſwade the Garriſon to ſurrender: The 4th. the <hi>Saxons</hi> reliev'd the Trenches, four Mortar-pieces with two Carcaſſes, were employ'd all night in caſting Stones, the reſt threw Bombs, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Cornaro</hi> march'd no farther on, but return'd with his Force, and the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laques,</hi> laden with rich Spoils, having had but nine men kill'd and three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wounded in this ſucceſsful Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
               <p>The Proveditor Extraordinary of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalonga</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Candie,</hi> gave
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31594:52"/>an account to the Senate, that, beſides many Incurſions that had been made by his Garriſon, from time to time, to the very Gates of the Enemies Towns, he had lately made a Detachment of part of his Forces, with deſign to fight the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels; that his Scouts having inform'd him where they lay encamp'd, he march'd towards them, and gain'd an entire Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; and that having poſſeſt himſelf of an advantageous Poſt, which before had much incommoded him: the confuſion the Infidels were in was redoubled, and moſt part of them kill'd on the place; ſome were drowned, and others diſperſt in the Mountains. There was alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that the Chriſtian Privateers, had taken in the Sea of <hi>Candia</hi> eight <hi>Saics</hi> laden with Corn and other Merchandiſe bound for <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> had view'd the Fortifications of <hi>Modon,</hi> and given ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary orders for its defence, he began to think of new Conqueſts, and call'd a Council of War for that purpoſe, where all the Principal Officers being preſent, it was reſolved to attack the City of <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> ſo call'd by the Inhabitants of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31594:52"/>the <hi>Morea.</hi> Before he put his deſign in execution, he thought it proper to clear the Country of ſome Garriſons that were in the ſmall places about <hi>Modon:</hi> he poſſeſt himſelf of the Town call'd <hi>Achaia;</hi> which tho it be not in it ſelf very conſiderable, yet it ſerves to ſecure the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts which the <hi>Venetians</hi> have made, and are ſtill making in that Kingdom. Whilſt we leave the Army under ſail towards <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> let us ſee what paſſes in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Forces of the Republique which are in theſe parts, have had many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages over the common Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeconded by the <hi>Morlaques. Solyman</hi> Baſha of <hi>Scutari</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> who took the Field in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> in order to beſiege ſome place in the Territories of the Republique, took much pains to little purpoſe. 'Tis true he advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City of <hi>Budoa</hi> and the Caſtle of St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> with deſign to ſeize them, and having forag'd thereabouts, to lay ſiege to <hi>Cattaro:</hi> In effect he us'd ſo much diligence that he quickly got within view of the place with his Army, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of twelve thouſand men, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31594:53"/>eight piece of Cannon, which gave ſome alarm to the Governour; but General <hi>Cornaro</hi> and the Count St. <hi>Paul</hi> having been inform'd of his deſign, had already prevented him with a number equal to his. The Baſha, who believ'd his deſign would not come to light till after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it, and imagin'd the Chriſtians could take no meaſures to traverſe it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd himſelf within four miles of the place, near the Town of <hi>Briach,</hi> and ſtay'd for the Artillery and the reſt of his Forces deſign'd for this Enterpiſe. In the mean time General <hi>Cornaro</hi> furniſh'd the City with all things neceſſary for its defence, in caſe the Enemies ſhould be ſo raſh as to lay ſiege to it; and having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a view of their Camp, he ſet his men in Battel-array: The Baſha did the ſame, and himſelf in perſon view'd the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army from a ſmall Hill on the South ſide. The firſt day paſt in divers light Skirmiſhes and frequent Alarms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming to a juſt Battel. But at the dawn of the next day, the <hi>Turks</hi> came upon the Chriſtians with great fury and loud cryes, as is cuſtomary with them: The firſt Squadrons of the <hi>Morlaques</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31594:53"/>their deſign, ſtay'd for them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtirring a foot, and with the help of their Artillery bore the firſt onſet. In this Rancounter, a Cannon Bullet having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off a Bough of a Tree, forc'd it ſo violently upon the Baſha, that his Face was grievouſly hurt by it: This Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent caus'd ſome diſorder amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and was no ſmall diſadvantage to them; for Signior <hi>Cornaro,</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Baſha retire out of the Field to dreſs his Wound, drew his Army out of the Camp againſt the Enemies. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace of four hours the Victory was in ſuſpence, but the Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforc'd by ſome freſh Battalions from the Galleys, the <hi>Turks</hi> gave ground on a ſudden, and not being able to make head, retir'd in confuſion towards their Camp; they loſt ſix hundred men in their flight, and many were taken Priſoners. Notwithſtanding this diſgrace, a thouſand <hi>Janiſaries</hi> made a freſh attack on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> but being briskly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd by the Garriſon, they loſt all hopes of taking the place, having loſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men in the attempt. This ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſo enrag'd the Baſha, that he had
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31594:54"/>caus'd ſeveral of the Captains to be ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, had they not beg'd their lives with a promiſe of clearing themſelves from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of cowardiſe on the firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in effect the fear of this reproach had ſo much influence on them, that two days after, having rally'd their Forces, they return'd in order of Battel to charge the Chriſtians; but they fell ſhort of their expectations, and were ſoon diſcomfited by thoſe Forces that backt the Chriſtian Army, with the help of the Cannon from the Galleys. There were four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred kill'd on the place, and the reſt forc'd to retire the third time in confuſion; the <hi>Venetians</hi> cloſely purſuing them, being deſirous to compleat a Victory they had ſo happily begun.</p>
               <p>The Forces of the Republick advanc'd their Conqueſts already made in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> by the taking of <hi>Napoli di Romania:</hi> This place, which is three parts ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sea, is ſituate in the Gulf that bears its name on a crooked neck of Land: its Harbour is ſafe, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a great number of Veſſels; but the mouth of it is ſo narrow and difficult that two Galleys cannot enter a breaſt:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31594:54"/>A Caſtle ſeated on a Rock within three hundred paces of it, ſerves for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and is ſo much the ſurer Guard to it, by reaſon that the Galleys and other Ships, not having a depth of water ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring them within Cannon ſhot, the Caſtle cannot eaſily be attack'd. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> II.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31594:55"/>of great Honour: He had been in <hi>Coron</hi> at the ſiege of that place, and had fallen into the hands of the <hi>Turks. Bajazet</hi> knowing his Authority to be great, would make uſe of him to move the beſieged to ſurrender; he advanc'd to the Walls, and ſeeing one of the Gates open, he ſpurr'd on with that ſpeed, that having diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himſelf from the <hi>Turks</hi> that were about him, he got into the place, and encourag'd the Inhabitants to make a good defence, and <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſome few days after rais'd the Siege and return'd to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.

But at laſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> finding it for the intereſt of their affairs, to make peace with <hi>Solyman,</hi> ſent <hi>Lewis Badoaro</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> with full power to treat.

For <hi>Solyman</hi> having been advertis'd by private intelligence, that the Republique had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him order to conclude a Treaty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt, oblig'd him to give up thoſe two places with two Caſtles in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> viz. <hi>Nadin</hi> and <hi>Laurane.</hi> This was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the year 1540. and ſince that time <hi>Napoli di Romania</hi> has continu'd under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominion.</p>
               <p>Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> having reſolv'd on the Siege of this place, ſet ſail on the 27th of <hi>July:</hi> The Army conſiſted of eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and ſix hundred Horſe, being the Forces of the Republique, which he embark'd on the Galleys and Galiots, with thoſe of the Pope, the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the Battalion of <hi>Malta:</hi> There were other Auxiliary Forces, who were embarkt on the other Ships and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſſes. A few days after, the Galleys and Galiots which ſet out firſt, arriv'd at the Port of <hi>Tolon,</hi> where on the 30th in the evening they landed without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; this Port is not above four or five
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31594:56"/>miles from <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> which they inveſted on the 31ſt; and it was reported by a Chriſtian Slave, that <hi>Haſſan</hi> Baſha, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> Baſha, and three Beys his Brothers, that were in the place, were the more reſolv'd to defend it ſtoutly, for that there was a numerous Garriſon, and great ſtore of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Proviſions. On the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> having begun the Lines of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation, they poſſeſt themſelves of Mount <hi>Palamida,</hi> on which they rais'd a Battery: this Mount lies on the ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Continent, and is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible but by a narrow way, which is between the ſteepeſt part of the Hill and the Sea. Three of the Soldiers that were commanded to cut of the paſſage of the water to the Caſtle, were kill'd, and four wounded; yet they executed their orders in ſpite of the Fire and Bombs of the Beſieged. On the ſame day news was brought, that the Seraſquier was encamp'd under the Cannon of <hi>Argos,</hi> but thoſe that brought it could not diſcover their number. On the 2d of the Month, they were informed by a <hi>Raſcian</hi> Deſerter, that the fire which was ſeen the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the City, had taken hold of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31594:56"/>above an hundred Quintals of Powder; that the ruins of the Magazine had chok'd up a great Ciſtern of water, and ſpoil'd another, and that the Inhabitants had but one Well left that was of uſe. The ſame day the beſieged made a Sally with two hundred Foot and twenty Horſe, but all they could do was to charge the advance Guards, and kill or wound ſix or ſeven Soldiers: The <hi>Germans</hi> came in, and being ſeconded by an hundred <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> preſently forc'd them to retire. In this Sally Major <hi>Lauro d' Andria</hi> receiv'd a Muſquet ſhot in his foot. The Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Galeaſſes that arriv'd the next day with the reſt of the Forces, reported that the Captain Baſha would have come to the place with ſeven of his Galleys, in which there were above three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, but that upon the advice they had, that the Fleet of the Republique was at the Mouth of the Haven they ſteered off towards <hi>Negropont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Generaliſſimo forgot nothing that might advance the good ſucceſs of the Siege: He took a view of the place on the ſide towards the Sea, from on Board the Galley commanded by the Governour
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31594:57"/>of the Galley-ſlaves; after which he took a turn on the ſide towards the Land, view'd the Poſts of Mount <hi>Palamida,</hi> and judging it would be difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his deſign as long as the Sea was open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the 6th, Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> left but fifteen hundred men to guard the Lines and march'd with the reſt againſt the Seraſquier. The Generaliſſimo advanc'd on his ſide with his Galleys, and having found a place fit for landing, near to <hi>Argos,</hi> he ſet a ſhore fifteen hundred Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and arm'd Seamen, to march under the command of Colonel <hi>Magnanini.</hi> This Conduct oblig'd the <hi>Turks</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Forces, they left a party to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Camp, and their Cavalry to the number of three thouſand went out to meet the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who receiv'd their firſt fire with great courage and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs. Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> marcht to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31594:57"/>them in very good order, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his opportunity, broke their Ranks and forc'd them to fly; but he not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it proper to purſue the Victory far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Enemy had time to carry off their Tents, and ſome part of their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; the Galleys had orders to make near the Coaſt to ſerve as a ſafe retreat to thoſe Souldiers that might be ſtragling for plunder. On the ſame day the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Mortars were finiſh'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bombard the Town where fire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſeveral places: Two other Works were likewiſe carried on to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it on the ſide towards the Sea. On the 7th. fourteen Chriſtian Slaves who had made their eſcape the Night before, reported that five hundred Souldiers and an Engineer had found means to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town by Sea; that the Seraſquier that had ſent this relief, drew his Forces together near <hi>Corinth</hi> to join with thoſe the Captain-Baſha had landed. Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> ſummon'd the Governour, and upon his refuſing to ſurrender, it was reſolv'd to burn all the adjacent Villages, and by that means hinder the <hi>Turks</hi> to lodge themſelves there. Count <hi>Coningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:31594:58"/>took upon himſelf the execution of this deſign, and ſoon made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Argos;</hi> thoſe that defended it, quitted the place without ſtriking a ſtroke. There were found in it ſome Proviſions, with about twelve thouſand pound of Powder. On the 8th. the battering was continued; five <hi>Grecians</hi> who eſcaped to the Camp, confirm'd what was reported by other Deſerters concerning the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the Bombs had made there; they added, that there was ſo general a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may amongſt them, that if <hi>Mustapha Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> had not oppoſed it, they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have accepted the offer of Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. On the 9th, four hundred men of thoſe Ships that had tranſported the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Modon</hi> into <hi>Barbary,</hi> were land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and took their Poſts. Advice was brought, that the Seraſquier was on his march with his Forces, and a Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two thouſand men to make ſome new attempt, and it appear'd to be for the relief of <hi>Napoli di Romania.</hi> On the 10th. about an hundred of his Horſe came within Piſtol-ſhot of the Trenches.

The Works ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been advanc'd to the foot of the Counterſcarp, on the 21ſt. all neceſſary Preparations were made for a deſcent into the Ditch.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31594:60"/>Skirmiſhes, preſently retir'd. The Beſiegers endured great Fatigues, being neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be at their Arms Night and Day by reaſon of theſe continual Skirmiſhes. On the 24th. they fell to undermine one ſide of the Counterſcarp. The 25th. the Galleys were ſent to get Forage for the Cavalry about ten miles from the place. The 26th. after they had made their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent to the Ditch, they began to work at the Galleries; it was a piece of Work that prov'd fatal to the Major of the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> who was kill'd on this occaſion by a Muſquet-ſhot, as Chevalier <hi>Alcena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> Major General, had been ſome days before, viewing the Ditch. The Serſquier advanc'd nearer the Beſiegers, which hindred the beſieged from deſiring a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, notwithſtanding the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation the whole Town was in; they were animated by his preſence, and making no doubt of being reliev'd, they wrought at their Retrenchments that they might defend themſelves in caſe the Beſiegers ſhould make ſo conſiderable a Breach as to venture on an Aſſault. On the 27th. Monſieur <hi>Venier</hi> return'd with the reſt of his Squadron.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:31594:60"/>
               <p>The Generaliſſimo ſaw his Army very much impair'd, ſeveral Officers being dead of their Diſtempers, many others were diſabled, and therefore, ſince a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Siege could not but be very diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him, he reſolv'd to go and attack the Seraſquier afreſh; and for that purpoſe, on the 28th. he made a great Detachment of Souldiers from his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Seamen, and Voluntiers, to make his Forces ſeem the more numerous. But on the 29th. at break of day the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſquier prevented him, coming in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the head of ten thouſand men to attack the Lines; he preſently made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of an Eminence which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded part of the Camp; and there being but one Squadron to guard that ſide, he made them give ground, and fell moſt furiouſly on the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> which not only ſtood firm, but repuls'd the <hi>Turks</hi> with ſuch vigor, that they were forc'd to turn back, and regain their Hill: Two Battalions of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> commanded by Count <hi>Coningsmark,</hi> march'd againſt them, and charg'd them with the greateſt Courage and Bravery imaginable. The
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31594:61"/>Generaliſſimo caus'd his grand Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Ships and Galleys, to advance, having firſt given all neceſſary orders for the ſafety of the Camp, and having plac'd himſelf at the head of ſome ſelect Forces, he charg'd the Enemies, whom this freſh ſupply and the other Forces that came from the Sea-ſide, had ſo terrify'd, that whatever their Officers could do, tho' they threatned them with their Swords in their Hands, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect kill'd ſome, could not ſtop the others from flying. The Battel laſted ſeven hours, and was very obſtinate on both ſides. The Infidels left fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of their men dead on the Field, and there were but three hundred kill'd or wounded on the Chriſtians ſide. The Defeat of the Seraſquier being made known to the Beſieged, by the joyful ſhouts of the Army in their return to the Camp, and the Standards they had taken from the Infidels, on the tops of which they had fix'd the Heads of thoſe they had ſlain in the Battel, it was now no time to conſider what was to be done. The Governour ſent three Deputies to the General's Galley, who granted them,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31594:61"/>that the Garriſon ſhould go out with their Arms and Baggage; That ten days ſhould be allow'd them to embark, and that they ſhould have a Convoy to <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</hi> The next day the Capitulation was adjuſted, the <hi>Turks</hi> put the Caſtle into the hands of the Generaliſſimo, and ſent Hoſtages without receiving any from him. The 31. Signior <hi>Moroſini,</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope's Galleys, with thoſe of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Malta,</hi> went into the Town, and there gave neceſſary orders. On the firſt of <hi>September</hi> it was under derlibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether or no they ſhould purſue the Seraſquier, but he himſelf took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ground of that Conſult, by retiring to <hi>Argos</hi> on the firſt tidings he had of the Surrender of the place. There were found in the Caſtle ſeventeen Braſs Cannon, ſeven of Iron, and one Mortar; in the City, an hundred piece of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, with great ſtore of Ammunition and Proviſions. There was great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn rejoicing at <hi>Venice</hi> for the taking of this important place; the Doge attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the Noblemen aſſiſted at the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> which was ſung in the Ducal Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where (as a token
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31594:62"/>of extraordinary Joy) the Standard of the <hi>Morea</hi> was expos'd, which till now had not been unfolded in the ſpace of theſe laſt hundred years. The great Services Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> had for ſome years perform'd for the Republique, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a ſignal Recompence, the Senate intending to confer upon him a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mark of Honour, made a Decree, that himſelf, his Brother, and all the eldeſt Sons of the Family, ſhould for ever be Knights, and ſhould enjoy all the Honours that attend that Dignity. The Senate being alſo deſirous to pay ſome marks of their acknowledgments to Count <hi>Conings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> who, during the whole Siege, had done all that might be expected from his known Courage and Conduct, it was ordered, that he ſhould be preſented with a Gold Baſon to the value of ſix thouſand Ducats.</p>
               <p>After the Capitulation, according to which the Garriſon and Inhabitants of the place were to be convey'd to <hi>Tenedos,</hi> the richeſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> ask'd leave of the Baſha to put their beſt Effects on board the Veſſel where he with all his Family was to embark, believing that there they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31594:62"/>would be beſt ſecur'd. The Baſha con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their requeſts, without permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to come on board themſelves. When they had ſet ſail, he caus'd the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot to ſteer his Courſe towards <hi>Venice,</hi> with deſign to ask the Protection of the Republique, being accompanied by his Brothers and the Governour of <hi>Chielifa,</hi> they were accordingly taken into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and while they kept their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantane in the Hoſpital, Lodgings were provided for them in the Seminary of Noblemen. It was thought that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Correſpondence Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> held with this Baſha, did more contribute to the ſurrender of <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> than all the Bombs and Carcaſſes that had been employ'd againſt it. But this is moſt certain, that by this Conqueſt more than ſixty Villages were brought under the Dominion of the Republique; <hi>Athens</hi> and many other places redeem'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from plunder by ſubmitting to an annual Tribute, and offering a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Summ in hand.</p>
               <p>Signior Proveditor of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> having diſappointed the Deſigns of the Baſſa of <hi>Scutari,</hi> was reſolv'd himſelf to make
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31594:63"/>ſome attempt on the <hi>Turks;</hi> the 19th. of <hi>September</hi> he march'd towards the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of <hi>Singe</hi> with the Pince of <hi>Parma,</hi> General of the Infantry, and the Count St. <hi>Paul.</hi> They led up two thouſand Foot which they had drawn out of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſix hundred of the regulated Forces, with a great number of <hi>Morlaques,</hi> both Horſe and Foot, and brought with them four Mortars, and three Field-pieces: they were to paſs through narrow and rugged ways; but they overcame that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and in three days march arriv'd before the place where they diſtributed the Poſts. The Batteries being made ready, they began to fire, and General <hi>Cornaro</hi> ſent to ſummon the beſieged: the anſwer was; The Chriſtians ſhould remember they had ineffectually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd that place the year before, and had bee forc'd to raiſe the Siege with ſhame and loſs; and as for themſelves, they were furniſh'd with great ſtore of all neceſſaries to make a good defence; That they had now good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſhould have the ſame ſucceſs; the Baſha of <hi>Ertzegovine</hi> was but one days march from the place, who would
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31594:63"/>certainly relieve them if occaſion were. The haughtineſs of their Anſwer was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by an action of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for they ſhot the man that had been ſent to ſummon them (who was a relation of Chevalier <hi>Janco</hi>) and by his Death confirm'd their intentions. General <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi> us'd all diligence to advance the Works, and continu'd firing on the place without intermiſſion. On the 28th. the Breach being wide enough, they made an aſſault, and notwithſtanding the ſtout reſiſtance they made, put the Beſieged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſorder, and forc'd them to quit the Town, and retire into the Caſtle; the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers attack'd them there with incredible vigour, and after a Fight of above an hour they took it, and cut in pieces the Garriſon which conſiſted of three hundred <hi>Turks:</hi> Moſt of their Heads were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to General <hi>Cornaro,</hi> who order'd two Sequins a Head to be given to thoſe that brought them. There was in the place a great Magazine of Ammunition, with eleven piece of Cannon. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers had forty men kill'd, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred wounded in this Expedition. The General gave the Government of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31594:64"/>place to Signior <hi>Boloni,</hi> and left there two hundred and fifty Foot, and a hundred Horſe in Garriſon; after which he return'd to <hi>Spalatro,</hi> laden with Honour and Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Conqueſt of <hi>Singe</hi> was of great Importance to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for by it the Poſſeſſion of a very rich Territory of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty Miles extent, was made ſure to them. The ſeaſon of the year being already much advanc'd, and the Snow beginning to fall in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> the Pope's auxiliary Galleys, with thoſe of <hi>Malta,</hi> having taken leave of the Generals, ſet ſail towards <hi>Sicily;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Gallipoli</hi> the 22d. of <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> ſuſtain'd alſo many loſſes at Sea; ſome time before the Galleys of <hi>Malta</hi> and Captain <hi>Venier</hi> had given chaſe to ſeveral Turkiſh Veſſels, had taken ſome, and ſo block'd up the Caravan in the Port of <hi>Scio,</hi> that it durſt not venture out; but the Fight that happened at Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſeven Turkiſh Veſſels, aſſiſted by twenty Galleys of the <hi>Beis,</hi> and Signior <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,</hi> Captain extraordinary of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Veſſels, was very much beyond theſe ſmall advantages: The particulars of it are very remarkable, as well for the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31594:64"/>of their Forces, as for the event of the Fight, which prov'd very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who in this action deliver'd many Chriſtians, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> were carrying into Slavery. And thus it happen'd: Signior <hi>Venier,</hi> who was order'd to convey the Garriſon of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli di Romania,</hi> having underſtood in his return, that ſome Turkiſh Veſſels were cruiſing about <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he deſir'd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd exactly where they were, and what was their number; it was told him there were but four, and no mention was made of the Galleys, either for that they had not been diſcover'd, or that there was ſome Treachery in him that made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. In the mean time the number that was told him, being in a manner, equal to his, which was of three Veſſels, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to fall on them, and advanc'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wind. But having ſent to view their number, he was ſurpriz'd to hear it was ſo much greater than he had been told: He underſtood there were ſeven Veſſels and twenty Galleys; and ſeeing ſo vaſt a diſadvantage, he reſolv'd to make back again, and endeavour'd it; but the Wind that favour'd his going
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31594:65"/>forward, was againſt his retreat; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels ſoon appear'd, giving great ſhouts, as if they had been ſure of the Victory Signior <hi>Venier,</hi> whom Diſcretion, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Venier</hi> not only bore their Onſet, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd them himſelf as he ſaw occaſion, eſpecialy after ſome of the Enemies Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniers were kill'd, which debarr'd them the uſe of their Cannon, and gave ſuch advantage to Signior <hi>Venier,</hi> that he ſunk ſome of their Veſſels, and gave chaſe to the reſt. The Infidels, who, during the Fight, had a particular care to keep the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31594:65"/>Slaves before mention'd, who were all in the ſame Veſſel, were now forc'd to leave them to the Conqueror, who content with his victory, left off the purſuit, which, however, he could not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, his Veſſel having loſt this Maſt. The Infidels were made happy in their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, by a circumſtance, without which not one of them had eſcap'd, which was that ſome days before the Fight Signior <hi>Venier</hi>'s Squadron had been diſperſed by contrary Winds; had he had all his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, 'tis eaſie to imagine how entire his Victory would have been; however 'tis to his great Honour that he came off ſo ſucceſsfully in ſo dangerous a buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The Infidels did all they could in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> (eſpecially ſince General <hi>Cornaro</hi> had taken <hi>Singe</hi>) to make ſome ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attempt upon the Chriſtians. The Baſha of <hi>Ertzegovine</hi> drew together twelve thouſand men, and march'd into the Field at the head of them, but attempted no farther than to make ſome Incurſions about <hi>Zara,</hi> and burn ſome Villages; 'tis true, he advanc'd under the Cannon of <hi>Singe,</hi> and gave ſome Allarm to the Governour, who had been advertis'd
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:31594:66"/>ſome days before, that the Baſha had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with ſome of his Officers, ſo that it behoved him to be vigilant whilſt he was in his Neighbourhood; but the true reaſon that this Baſha had taken the Field, was to put Ammunition in <hi>Clin,</hi> which he effected, though oppos'd by a Party.</p>
               <p>This Baſha, who is a daring man, gave ſome trouble to the Proveditor-General, who fear'd leſt by the favour of the Ice, he would make ſome attempt upon the new Conqueſts; for which cauſe he promis'd great Rewards to the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> if they would continue firm to the Service of the Republique. But whatever he could do, ſome were found amongſt them who had undertaken to kill Chevalier <hi>Janco</hi> their Commander, a man very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for which reaſon he was become odious to the Baſha, who had promis'd thoſe Traytors a good Summ of Money, provided they brought him his Head; but he had notice of the Deſign time enough to prevent it. He caus'd one of the Villains to be ſeiz'd, the other made his eſcape, well knowing no mercy was to be hop'd after ſuch a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31594:66"/>Crime. In the mean time the Proveditor General was uneaſie under theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſent an Account to <hi>Venice</hi> of the Trouble he was in, and how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it was to ſend him ſome aſſiſtance. Thus ended the Campaigne in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time Signior <hi>Moroſini,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took his Winter Quarters, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd himſelf of the Iſle of <hi>Maxos</hi> in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> a Conqueſt not very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in it ſelf, (but the place being well fortify'd both by Situation and Art) it may be of ill Conſequence to the <hi>Turks,</hi> which obliges the Chriſtians to work there with great diligence; and there are already eight thouſand Workmen ſent thither, the Republique ſparing no Coſt either for that, or any other Expences of the War. General <hi>Moroſini,</hi> after he had been in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where the <hi>Turks</hi> trembled for fear, not thinking themſelves ſafe in any Fortreſs, return'd to <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> where the Deputies of <hi>Athens</hi> waited for him to know upon what terms they might be admitted into the Protection of the Republique, deſiring to do it by a voluntary Contribution, notwithſtanding that the Infidels threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31594:67"/>to complain at <hi>Constantinople</hi> of their proceeding, as contrary to the obedience they ow'd the Grand Signior, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all by Fire and Sword, rather than conſent.</p>

               <p>Signior <hi>Peraſtino,</hi> Captain of a Veſſel named, <hi>Our Lady of Mountaigne,</hi> arriving at the Port of <hi>Suda</hi> to take in Proviſions and freſh Water, Signior <hi>Alviſe Marcello,</hi> Proveditor Extraordinary, deſir'd him to take in Water at <hi>Seignet</hi> near <hi>Canea,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf having no more than was neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of his Garriſon. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd on the ſide of <hi>Porto Nuovo,</hi> with eighteen Seamen, having a Convoy of fifty eight men to attend him by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Proveditor. <hi>Ali Cubi,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Canea,</hi> having notice of it from the Inhabitants of <hi>Cisterna,</hi> ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>Ali Bey</hi> with eighteen Horſe to view the Chriſtians; the <hi>Ali</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd them, retir'd to <hi>Ciſterna;</hi> the Inhabitants diſpatch'd a ſecond Courier to the Baſha of <hi>Canea,</hi> who made a ſecond Detachment of threeſcore men. Theſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31594:68"/>two Detachments being joyn'd, yet durſt not attack the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd themſelves at <hi>Citro,</hi> and were all arm'd with Muſquets to receive the Infidels. The Baſha having been inform'd of it by a third Courier, reſolv'd to go himſelf at the head of a Detachment of four hundred Horſe and Foot, ſcorning that a handful of Men ſhould thus brave him. But his Son having diſſwaded him from that Enterpriſe, took it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and march'd towards them with a deſign to break through them. They were receiv'd by the <hi>Venetians</hi> with Muſquet-ſhot: The Fight was long and bloody, both ſides encountring with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual vigour. The Baſha's Son attack'd the Chriſtians ſeveral times with all the fury of a Commander, reſolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer in deſpite of Fortune; yet the <hi>Turks</hi> were at laſt forc'd to retreat by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Night, with the loſs of many men: There were an hundred wounded, of which number was the Baſha's Son, who died in a few hours; his Horſe and Sword were taken and ſent to General <hi>Moroſini.</hi> This Baſha's Son was Nephew to the Sultan lately depos'd, about five
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31594:69"/>and twenty years of Age; he ſhew'd in this Action a Courage and Conduct above his years: His Father was ſo enrag'd at this ill ſucceſs, that he impriſon'd the ſecond <hi>Ali Bey,</hi> threatning to be reveng'd on him for the Death of his Son.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Turks,</hi> to keep their Forces in heart, reſolv'd to beſiege <hi>Singe</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that on the event of this Siege depended the Succeſs of the whole Campaigne. In effect they inveſted the place with twenty thouſand men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Baſha's of <hi>Boſſine</hi> and <hi>Ertzegovine,</hi> and twenty ſix piece of Cannon, with ſome Mortars, which they divided in three Batteries. They thought themſelves ſo ſure of carrying the Town, that the next day after they came before it, they ſent away eight thouſand men to attempt to enter into the Province of <hi>Zoga.</hi> The Marquis <hi>Borri,</hi> General of the Battalia, and Governour of the place, writ to General <hi>Cornaro</hi> as ſoon as he found himſelf beſieged, that he wanted neither Men nor Proviſions, and that he was the more reſolute to defend it, in that he hop'd he ſhould in a ſhort time
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31594:69"/>be reliev'd. Signior <hi>Cornaro</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd to hear this reſolution, yet did not in the mean time neglect to ſend a Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men who got into the place, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vigilance of the Enemy. In the mean time the <hi>Turks</hi> with twelve thouſand men that remain'd, attack'd a Rondel, and made three aſſaults one after another, in all which they were repuls'd. The Garriſon made ſeveral Sallies with ſo good ſucceſs, that they cut off the Heads of above an hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> and plac'd them on the Walls to give terrour to the reſt. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing themſelves ſo miſtaken in their meaſures, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Detachment, ſent to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Governour, and to terrifie him, they let him know that no quarter ſhould be given, unleſs he ſurrendred; that the relief he might pretend to expect, was at ſo great a diſtance, that the place would be taken before it could come: They bid him conſider of it; but the beſt advice they could give him, was to provide for his affairs in good time. The Governour having receiv'd this Complement, gave them for anſwer, That if either Party had reaſon to fear, it muſt certainly be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31594:70"/>That they were deluded by falſe hopes; That they might have inferr'd from the reſiſtance he had already made, that it would not be eaſie for them to ſucceed in their deſign; That if inſtead of giving him advice, they would receive any from him, he advis'd them in good earneſt not to perſiſt in ſo vain an attempt; That he would have them know, that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Cornaro</hi> was on his march to relieve him; and that to avoid a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, they would do well to retire, and make no longer ſtay there. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer making them underſtand they had no fearful man to deal with, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the Siege, but with ſo little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that at the end of three Weeks they were no farther advanc'd than on the firſt day. In the mean time the brave reſiſtance of the beſieged having given time to General <hi>Cornaro</hi> to draw together his Forces, who were yet in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he march'd to their relief. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor <hi>Zen,</hi> General of the Horſe, join'd him with eighteen hundred men, and Chevalier <hi>Janco</hi> brought him a thouſand <hi>Morlaques,</hi> which altogether made up fourteen thouſand men. General <hi>Zen</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:31594:70"/>commanded the Cavalry, General <hi>San Paolo</hi> the Foot, and General <hi>Cornaro</hi> the whole Body of the Army. They arriv'd on the 22d. of <hi>April</hi> to a place call'd <hi>Liſm,</hi> not far from the Enemies Camp, where they made a halt; two hundred men were ſent to a Hill to give notice to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged of the approach of Relief, by a Volley; at the noiſe of which the Infidels came to view the Chriſtians, and found the whole Army was on its march to make them raiſe the Siege. The <hi>Turks</hi> would not ſtay their coming up, though they were the greater number. They prepar'd for their retreat on the 23. of <hi>April</hi> in the Evening, by ſending away their Cannon and Baggage, which was follow'd by the Foot and Horſe. The Beſieged at the ſame time made a Salley, charg'd thoſe that ſtay'd laſt in the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and fill'd up their Works. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies during the Siege, and in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, loſt above three and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and ſome Officers of ſeveral ſtations. In the mean time Chevalier <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> who was gone before with his <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laques,</hi> was ſurpriz'd to ſee that the <hi>Turks</hi> had rais'd the Siege in ſuch haſte, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31594:71"/>that their Horſe had already gain'd the Bridge of <hi>Cettina.</hi> He entred their Camp, where he found ſome Barrels of Powder, ſome Swords, and one piece of Cannon, which the Enemies had left, having firſt nail'd it. The 24th. General <hi>Cornaro</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Town, being extremely well ſatisfy'd with the vigorous reſiſtance the Garriſon had made, and gave a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Commendations to Marquis <hi>Borri,</hi> and the other Officers who had ſignalliz'd themſelves on this occaſion. The Senate being advertis'd of it, caus'd conſiderable Preſents to be made them, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had each of them a piece of money. On the 25th. <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung. On the 26th. the General retir'd to <hi>Spalatro,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt given neceſſary Orders for the reparation of the place, and the Forces return'd to their Quarters.</p>
               <p>The Baſha of <hi>Ertzegovine</hi> being next, that he could not ſucceed in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, took his revenge for that diſgrace by waſting the Territory of <hi>Trau,</hi> reap'd the Harveſt, and carry'd away all the Corn. This Baſha gathered together three thouſand men more, and march'd towards the Fort of <hi>Opuſch,</hi> a little place
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31594:71"/>ſituate on the River <hi>Narenta,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to attack it. He flatter'd himſelf with the thought, that he need no more than ſhew himſelf to gain the place; but the Governour of the place had very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sentiments, inſtead of opening the Gates to him, as he expected, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his little Garriſon, that a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Death was better than a ſhameful Servitude, which was all could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if they ſurrendred on diſcretion, and that they would not die without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing a great number of the Infidels. Signior <hi>Cornaro</hi> having notice of this, thought himſelf oblig'd without delay to ſecond the good reſolution of the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for this purpoſe he commanded ſome Forces of that ſide to march, and ſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Chevalier <hi>Janco</hi> to be there with the <hi>Morlaques,</hi> three Galleys, and ſome other Veſſels to tranſport the Forces. This march, and the reſolution of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, oblig'd the Baſha to retire, not being willing to engage himſelf farther in an attempt which was like to prove as vain as that of <hi>Singe</hi> had been. But the <hi>Morlaques</hi> not content to have diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Enemies Deſigns, ſurpriz'd the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31594:72"/>Suburbs of <hi>Dumno,</hi> and ſeveral Villages of that Country, which they pillag'd and burnt: The Booty they carry'd away, conſiſted of many Priſoners, with a great number of Sheep and Cattel.</p>
               <p>During this time the Pirates of <hi>Dulcig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> went on ſhore in the Territories of the Republique, and carry'd many away into Slavery, and amongſt others, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Citta-Nova,</hi> with all his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Some Veſſels were commanded out to cut them off in their return, but could not light on theſe Pirates.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> had ſhew'd much Experience, Courage and Conduct in the Service of the Republique. The King of <hi>Suedes,</hi> who had a value for him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remanded him, the Doge writ the following Letter to his Majeſty, which here you have in the ſame terms as it came from <hi>Stockholm.</hi>

               <p>The Plague, with which many Cantons of the <hi>Morea</hi> were infected, was the cauſe that the <hi>Venetians</hi> entred late into action. The <hi>Turks</hi> who were reſolv'd to keep on the defenſive part, might have made great progreſs on that ſide by oppoſing their Enemies with equal numbers, ſince the Pope's Galleys, thoſe of <hi>Malta,</hi> and of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> came not to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> by reaſon of the apprehenſion they had of the Plague; but all prov'd quite contrary, and there was ſomething ſo ſurpriſing and wonderful in the good ſucceſs the Chriſtians met with in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> that upon due reflection, it ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible; the good underſtanding that was between the Generals, did not a little contribute to it, who, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of different Sentiments, yet were always united in the ſame methods by the conſideration of the publick good, as may appear by what follows.</p>
               <p>A little before the Naval Army went from <hi>Climno,</hi> a Turkiſh Aga put himſelf under the Protection of the Republique, who reported that the Infidels had an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my conſiſting of twelve thouſand choice men, who were encamp'd near <hi>Patras,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:31594:74"/>and another of ſix thouſand near <hi>Miſitra.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide, had but ſeven thouſand Foot, twelve hundred Dragoons, and about the ſame number of <hi>Sclavonians.</hi> The Pope's Forces, and thoſe of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> not having joyn'd them for fear of the Plague, made a diminution of three thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The Commanders of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were Generaliſſimo <hi>Moroſini,</hi> Count <hi>Coningsmark,</hi> who was happily recover'd of a hurt he receiv'd by the kicking of a Horſe, and a Fever that was caus'd by it; Prince <hi>Maximilian William</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> General, who was newly arriv'd with a Reinforcement of ſome freſh Regiments; and Lieutenant General <hi>D' Avila,</hi> who notwithſtanding his great Age, was very vigorous.</p>
               <p>Under the Conduct of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, the Army left <hi>Climno</hi> the 20th. of <hi>July</hi> towards the Evening, and by the favour of the Wind, were the next day in the Morning near <hi>Patras;</hi> ſome were ſent immediately to view the Dardanels that guard the mouth of the Gulf of <hi>Lepante,</hi> and obſerve whether they might land their Forces there; but they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:31594:74"/>that the Enemies had made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments all along the Coaſt. The ſame day in the Evening they went to the other ſide of the Gulf, but found that the Enemy expected to be attack'd on that ſide, and that they had divided their Army into four Camps; one being above <hi>Patras,</hi> another on the mid-way between <hi>Patras</hi> and the Dardanels, the third on the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Caſtle of <hi>Romelia,</hi> and the fourth on the nearer ſide of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Morea.</hi> The Gulf of <hi>Lepante</hi> has four Rocks. The <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea runs into it by a mouth form'd by two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories which ſhoot themſelves on each ſide into the Sea; that which is in the <hi>Morea</hi> is call'd <hi>Capo Antirio;</hi> it is guarded by a Caſtle which is call'd indifferently <hi>the Castle of Patras,</hi> or <hi>of Morea.</hi> The other which is in <hi>Achaia,</hi> is call'd <hi>Capo Rione;</hi> it has alſo a Fortreſs call'd the <hi>Caſtle of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia.</hi> Theſe Caſtles are commonly call'd <hi>the Dardanels of Lepant.</hi> They are of a Square form, and have good Walls, with Batteries near the ſurface of the Water.</p>
               <p>On the 22d. at break of Day they landed on the right hand of <hi>Patras,</hi> about the diſtance of two French Leagues from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:31594:75"/>the Fortreſs, and a quarter of a League from the <hi>Turks</hi> Retrenchments. This landing was made without any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it was ſaid afterwards by the Priſoners, that the Seraſquier ſuffer'd it on purpoſe, being reſolv'd upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to conquer or die. The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being poſted along the Sea-Coaſt, about an hundred Turkiſh Horſe came up and charg'd the <hi>Hanover</hi> Forces, but were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly repuls'd with the loſs of twenty men, there being but two of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans kill'd, and ſeven wounded. The next day a Council of War was held to debate what way was to be taken to attack the Enemies in their Camp, or force them to Battel. The way by land was very bad, and there was a Wood to paſs of near a League and a half, ſo that that was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impoſſible; it was found equally dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to go by Sea, the Paſſage being very narrow, and the Enemy expecting to be attack'd on that ſide, had plac'd there a Battery of ſome Cannon; this made them reſolve to go round the Wood, and attack the Enemy behind; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution the Generaliſſimo could hardly be induc'd to approve, thinking their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31594:75"/>march would be at too great a diſtance from the Sea; but when Count <hi>Conings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> had ſent him an Approbation of it, ſign'd by all the Generals and Colonels, he agreed to it.</p>
               <p>They march'd in the Evening, having made Proviſion for ſome days, they left the Mountains on their right hand, and the Wood and the Sea on their left. They met with ſome very rugged ways in their march, and ſo narrow that they could not paſs two a breaſt; from whence it may be judged with how much difficulty they brought on the Artillery, which was done by thoſe of the Galleys. Signior <hi>Sanudo,</hi> Captain of the Gulf, had paſs'd the Dardanels on the 23d. in the Evening to cut off the Communication between the Turkiſh Camps; and on the 24th. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Noon the Chriſtian Army appear'd before the Enemy in very good order, the forces of <hi>Hanover</hi> being for the greateſt part on the right Wing, and the whole Army drawn up in a ſquare Body.</p>
               <p>The Enemy preſently march'd out of the Trenches with ten thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe, and gave the firſt Volley, though at ſome diſtance; the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31594:76"/>Cavalry with their Swords in their hands, charg'd the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the left Wing, but Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> advanc'd with his Squadrons, and all the Cavalry commanded by the Marquis of <hi>Courbon,</hi> who was very well ſeconded by Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> meeting there with ſo ſtrong reſiſtance, turn'd all their Forces on the right Wing; there were amongſt them two thouſand Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, each of whom had been regal'd by the Seraſquier with five and twenty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and a promiſe of as much more after the Victory. The three old Regiments of <hi>Hanover</hi> made the Front and Flank of the right Wing, and thoſe newly come, the main Body. They let their Enemies advance within ten paces diſtance, which made them attempt to hew down with their Swords the <hi>Chevaux de Friſei,</hi> but were repuls'd by ſuch thick Volleys of Muſquet-ſhot, that all their Efforts were in vain, though they ſeveral times renew'd the Charge; ſo that after they had loſt a great number of their men, the Seraſquier himſelf being wounded, and the Baſha of <hi>Vallona</hi> kill'd on the place, the reſt were forc'd to fly, and were hotly purſu'd by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31594:76"/>the Dragoons and <hi>Sclavonians.</hi> Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> obſerving that the Forces of <hi>Hanover</hi> ſo well perform'd their Duty, and that they appear'd as void of fear as in their uſual Exerciſes, could not but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare aloud, that he doubted not of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, ſince he ſaw thoſe Forces in the place of greateſt danger. He commended in publique before the Generaliſſimo, the undaunted Courage the Prince of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi> had ſhewn both in this Action and paſt Campaigns, his Forces having been very much encourag'd by his brave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. There were found in the Field above an hundred <hi>Turks</hi> kill'd, moſt of them on the ſide of the right Wing: About a thouſand paces within the Wood, there had been above five hundred <hi>Turks</hi> ſlain, and a like number of wounded in the Camp; on the reſt of the way through which they fled, there were found near an hundred more of theſe Infidels kill'd or wounded, without reckoning thoſe that ſtragled, and were deſtroyed elſewhere, which in all might make near two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reſt having eſcap'd and paſs'd the Mountains in diſorder. Of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Forces there were but thirty loſt. Amongſt the Officers, Lieutenant <hi>Butler</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:31594:77"/>of the Regiment of <hi>Rangrafe,</hi> was kill'd, and Captain <hi>Rabe,</hi> who was there as a Voluntier, receiv'd three dangerous Wounds in the Arm. A Colonel of the <hi>Sclavonians</hi> was kill'd and his loſs very much reſented, he being a man of ſingular merit. The Seraſquier's great Standard was taken with ten others. The Tents had moſt of them been rais'd and carry'd away from the Camp, but there were found ſix pieces of Artillery, ſome Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons laden with Ammunition and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and a great number of Horſes and Arms: They took alſo fourteen Galleys which the <hi>Turks</hi> had left in the Gulf.</p>
               <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Patras</hi> having ſeen this defeat, and that Captain <hi>Negro</hi> was advancing towards them with ſome Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, quitted the place with all the Artillery and Ammunition that was in it. <hi>Patras</hi> is a very ancient City, and the Seat of an Archbiſhop; its ſituation is convenient for Traffick and Navigation. It takes up ſeven hundred paces of the Gulf of <hi>Patras,</hi> where the Port of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normo</hi> is. In the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Inhabitants were Citizens of <hi>Rome:</hi> There are at this time many <hi>Jews,</hi> who make it a place of Trade, and it is the only
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31594:77"/>place of theſe Coaſts, where the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the neighbouring Iſlands, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> are wont to traffick. It was a Dutchy in time of the <hi>Deſpots,</hi> but thoſe Princes finding themſelves too weak to defend it, ſold it to the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the year 1408. the <hi>Turks</hi> took it from them in 1463. In 1533. <hi>Doria</hi> beſieg'd it and took it; a little time after he made ſure his Conqueſt by the reduction of the Fortreſs that commands it, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred it ſelf, though it had formerly held out againſt a powerful Army of the Emperor <hi>Conſtantinus Palaeologus.</hi> The next year the <hi>Turks</hi> return'd and expell'd the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time Baſha <hi>Mehemet,</hi> who was with ſix thouſand men near the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Romelia,</hi> fled alſo with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the place, having firſt blown up part of it. <hi>Guiſulderem Mahemet,</hi> who was near the Caſtle of <hi>Morea,</hi> did the ſame, having diſcover'd the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys early in the Morning making towards the place from the Dardanels; but what is moſt ſurpriſing is, that the City of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pante,</hi> which is very ſtrong, ſurrendred it ſelf without reſiſtance at the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31594:78"/>they made from far of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> Naval Army. The Garriſon went away with as much as every Souldier could carry on his back. The Generaliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo entred the place, and ſet up the Standard of the Republique. <hi>Lepant</hi> is an Archbiſhop's See; it is built all round a Hill, on the top of which is the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, ſurrounded with four thick Walls divided from each other by the Vallies where the Houſes of the Inhabitants ſtand. The Haven is of five hundred paces, the mouth of it fifty, and the Channel is not deep. However the famous Pirate <hi>Darach Bey</hi> harbour'd there formerly with his Galleys. There have been four Temples conſecrated, to <hi>Neptune, Venus, Æſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> and <hi>Diana:</hi> There are at preſent ſeven Moſques, two Churches for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and three Synagogues for the <hi>Jews.</hi> There are on the Eaſt-ſide near the Sea abundance of fine Springs which afford Water to the Mills for Powder us'd by thoſe that dreſs Spaniſh Leather, the Trade of the Inhabitants being in that Powder. Theſe Springs afterwards gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on at the Foot of twelve great Plane trees, form a place of much delight, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31594:78"/>then ſupply a great many curious Gardens with their Waters; their Banks are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd with Citron, Limmon and Orange trees; the Territory produces excellent Wine. In the year 1408. <hi>Lepant</hi> was under the Imperial Seat of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but <hi>Emanuel,</hi> who then rul'd, not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſtrong enough to defend the place, put it into the hands of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, the <hi>Venetians</hi> put it into a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making a good defence. In 1475. it was beſieged by thirty thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> who having batter'd it during the ſpace of four months, in vain, were forc'd to raiſe the Siege. But in the year 1498. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> the ſecond attack'd it at the head of 150000. men, and took it.</p>
               <p>It ſeems almoſt incredible that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> ſhould gain all theſe Advantages in the ſpace of four and twenty hours, but it is certain they won the Battel, and gain'd theſe four important Fortreſſes in leſs than a day and a half, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Morning of the 23d. of <hi>July,</hi> to ten of the Clock the next day. They found in the Camp, and the places the <hi>Turks</hi> had quitted, one hundred forty five piece of Artillery, and in the Gulf of <hi>Lepant,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31594:79"/>Gallies, Galeaſſes, and other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels charg'd with Proviſions, and ſome Chriſtians whom they immediately ſet at liberty.</p>
               <p>It happen'd ſome days before the action laſt mention'd, that <hi>Polani</hi> the Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of <hi>Zarnata,</hi> detach'd two thouſand men, who were joyn'd by a thouſand more from the Proveditor of <hi>Coron;</hi> they encamp'd within two leagues of the Town of <hi>Larithene,</hi> their aim being to ſurprize it, which the Seraſquier under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he ſent out an hundred and fifty Horſe to view the Chriſtians Camp. The <hi>Mainotts</hi> intercepted their paſſage, and advanc'd up to the Town; the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ſally'd out, to attack this handful of <hi>Mainotts;</hi> the other three thouſand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come up, thoſe of <hi>Larithene,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſave themſelves in the Town, but the others entred Pell-mell with them, and pillag'd the Town, giving quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to none but four hundred perſons whom they made Slaves.</p>
               <p>After Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> had ſent an account of theſe Progreſſes to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, it was order'd by them in full Senate, That the Arms of this moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31594:79"/>General ſhould be ſet up in the great Council Hall, and that Count <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsmark</hi>'s annual Penſion ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd ſix thouſand Ducats. At the ſame time a Preſent of four thouſand Ducats was aſſign'd to the Prince of <hi>Hanover,</hi> and a Sword of two thouſand to Viſcount <hi>Turene;</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Courbon</hi>'s pay was encreas'd two thouſand Ducats by giving him the place of Serjeant-General of the Battalia; and proportionable acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments were made to all thoſe who had had the Honour to ſignalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The firſt care the Generaliſſimo took after his new Conqueſts, was, not only to give ſolemn thanks to God, but to cauſe all the Churches to be re-conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, which had been us'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels for Moſques. Theſe Churches were dedicated under the Name of ſeveral Saints, and given to ſeveral religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; at <hi>Patras</hi> one was conſecrated to the Immaculate Conception, and given to the Coventual Fryers; another ſituate in the Suburbs, was dedicated to Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> who (by the Report of ſeveral Authors) had there ſuffer'd Martyrdom
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:31594:80"/>under the Proconſul <hi>Ægeus;</hi> it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the diſcalc'd Carmelites. The Moſque of <hi>Lepant</hi> was conſecrated anew under the name of Saint <hi>James,</hi> that City being reduc'd under the obedience of the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the Feaſt day of that Saint. Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the Government of the Church, took into his conſideration the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Places he had taken, and nam'd all neceſſary Officers, to the end that the People being furniſh'd with all things, might enjoy that peace and reſt which had long been unknown to them. Signior <hi>Girolamo Priuli</hi> was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Patras,</hi> and Signior <hi>Pietro Grioni,</hi> Lieutenant; Signior <hi>Tadeo Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denigo,</hi> Governour of <hi>Lepant;</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>Meſſulipa,</hi> Lieutenant; Signior <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Barbarigo,</hi> Governour of the Caſtle of <hi>Morea;</hi> and Signior <hi>Girolamo Tepolo,</hi> Lieutenant: that of <hi>Romelia</hi> had for Governour, Signior <hi>Alviſe Sagredo</hi> till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orders. Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> ſent to ſummon the Caſtle <hi>Torneſe,</hi> which is a Fortreſs near the Province of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> between the Gulf of <hi>Chiarenza</hi> and that of <hi>Arcadia;</hi> it is built upon an eminence
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:31594:80"/>about three miles diſtant from the Sea. The Aga who was there, made no reſiſtance, but deſir'd to capitulate, and after the firſt Summons quitted the place; it was the ſole defence of two hundred Villages and Forts in that moſt fruitful part of the <hi>Morea;</hi> all which ſubmitted themſelves; an hundred and fifty <hi>Turks</hi> that deſired it, receiv'd Baptiſm, the reſt retir'd towards <hi>Achaia.</hi> There were found in <hi>Caſtle-Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> nine piece of Braſs Cannon, and twenty of Iron.</p>
               <p>The Seraſquier, after the loſs of <hi>Patras,</hi> retir'd to <hi>Corinth</hi> with the remnant of his Army, and Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> being deſirous to compleat his Victory, and at the ſame time let the Seraſquier ſee he had both Courage and Strength enough to take that place whither he had retir'd with all his Forces, made towards the Gulf of <hi>Corinth</hi> with his Fleet, augmented now with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Galeots which had been taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Caſtles of <hi>Lepant;</hi> in the mean time Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> on his part ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd thither by land.</p>
               <p>The Seraſquier having heard of this march, and not finding among the four thouſand men he had, reſolution enough
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31594:81"/>to defend themſelves, fell into ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, that he caus'd fire to be ſet to the Magazines of Powder and Victuals, and to ſome Houſes in the City and Out-town, and blew up ſome part of the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then took his flight towards <hi>Thebes,</hi> and ſo quitted the <hi>Morea.</hi> He ſent Orders before to the Governours of ſome Fortreſſes to ſet fire to them, and joyn him with their Garriſons and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the craggy Mountains of <hi>Thebes,</hi> there to wait for relief from <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> He burn'd, deſtroy'd, and kill'd all the <hi>Greeks</hi> he found in his way, becauſe they ſeem'd not diſpos'd to make ſuch oppoſition to the <hi>Venetians</hi> as he expected; to which he added, That they were the cauſe of all the ill ſucceſs of the War; but thoſe of that Nation being provok'd by ſuch barbarous uſage, kill'd two thouſand of his men, and made four hundred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
               <p>As they drew nearer to <hi>Corinth,</hi> they perceiv'd afar off the reſt of the Turkiſh Cavalry on their flight, and the City ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd on fire; but it was quench'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it conſum'd all the Magazines, and there was found great ſtore of Victuals
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31594:81"/>and Ammunition, beſides ſix and forty Braſs Cannon, and four of Iron. The chief of the <hi>Grecians</hi> who were come out of the City to meet the <hi>Venetians,</hi> fell at the feet of the Generaliſſimo in the name of the reſt of the Inhabitants, and told him there were no <hi>Turks</hi> in the place, but that they believ'd ſome of them were at <hi>Miſitra.</hi> A great Detachment was plac'd in Garriſon at <hi>Corinth;</hi> two Companies in the Citadel, from whence a like number of the <hi>Turks</hi> were fled, and there the Standard of St. <hi>Mark</hi> was ſet up: Signior <hi>Moroſini</hi> view'd the place, and provided all things they might ſtand in need of; he receiv'd the ſubmiſſion of the Metropolitan, and many other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts. They ſhew'd to the <hi>Venetians</hi> the <hi>Mount Parnaſſus,</hi> the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Helicon,</hi> and that of <hi>Pirene</hi> ſo ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by <hi>Homer;</hi> a Statue of <hi>Janus</hi> found in the Suburbs of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the <hi>Tomb of Diogenes,</hi> the Ruins of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Minerva,</hi> and ſeveral other pieces of Antiquity, as alſo the marks of the Wall built by the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the year 1463. to encloſe the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31594:82"/>landed his Forces to joyn them with thoſe of <hi>Bertold d' Eſte,</hi> and employ them joyntly on this Work; thirty thouſand Workmen were ſet to it, who in the ſpace of fifteen days finiſh'd it, adding to it double Ditches, and an hundred thirty ſix Towers. This Work was call'd <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion</hi> by reaſon of its length, which was ſix miles; in the middle of it, as ſoon as it was finiſh'd, an Altar was prepar'd, and the whole Army heard Maſs there. This Country was famous for the <hi>Iſthmian Games,</hi> the <hi>Temple of Neptune,</hi> and the <hi>Forrest of Pines,</hi> of whoſe Branches Crowns were made for the <hi>Champions.</hi>

                  <hi>Miſitra</hi> is a City ſo conſiderable that it deſerves a particular Deſcription: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more celebrated amongſt the Ancients than the Names of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> and <hi>Sparta.</hi> This City that now bears the name of <hi>Miſitra</hi> was once call'd by both thoſe names; the firſt upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Lelex,</hi> the other from Queen <hi>Sparta,</hi> Daughter of the ſame <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> and <hi>Europa;</hi> though ſome Authors are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that his laſt name was given by <hi>Spartus</hi> Son of <hi>Phoroneus</hi> King of <hi>Argos,</hi> who was its firſt Founder. Its Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence has anciently been Forty eight Stades; the ground it ſtands on is part plain and part riſing: The Mount <hi>Tayge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> Commands it; but what is moſt to be admir'd, is, that this City preſerv'd it ſelf Eight hunder'd years, without Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, againſt the frequent Attempts of all its Enemies, and that it no ſooner had Walls but it grew leſs Proſperous, and oftner chang'd its Maſter. Its Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is 35 Degrees 26 Minute: This City is divided into four Parts, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the new Town, the middle Suburbss and the out Suburbs; this laſt is ſeparated
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31594:84"/>from the other Parts by the <hi>Vaſili Potamos,</hi> over which there is a Bridge for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; the Caſtle is ſituate on an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence which bears the form of a Sugar Loaf: there are ſeveral Ciſterns of Water, and in the middle of it a <hi>Moſque,</hi> which was formerly a Church of the Chriſtians; the Situation of it is ſo advantageous, that all Hiſtorians agree it was never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by force, though it has been briskly aſſaulted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> the Second. The <hi>Deſpots</hi> caus'd it to be built about the time when the <hi>Graecian</hi> Empire began to decay: Authors are not agreed concerning the Foundation of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon;</hi> but according to the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Father <hi>Petau,</hi> it might be 3422. years ſince this City was built; and ſo it will be more ancient than <hi>Carthage, Sira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, Alexandria, Lyons,</hi> or <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which are reputed the moſt ancient Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the World. The <hi>Deſpot Theodore</hi> in the Year 1405. ſold <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> to <hi>Phillibert de Naillac,</hi> Prior of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and Great Maſter of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but the Treaty was without effect: <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> left this City to his Nephew of his own Name, Son to the Emperor <hi>Emanuel.</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:31594:84"/>This <hi>Theodore</hi> the Second married an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Lady, of the Houſe of <hi>Malateſta,</hi> by which means the Title of Duke of <hi>Sparta</hi> fell to that Family; he ſucceeded his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John</hi> in the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and plac'd his youngeſt Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which fell at laſt to the ſhare of Prince <hi>Demetrius,</hi> from whom it was taken by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second in 1460. and 3200. years after its Foundation. <hi>Benedetto Colleone</hi> took this City in 1473. but by his death was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from taking the Caſtle.

               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Albanians</hi> and <hi>Morlaques</hi> of the <hi>Morea</hi> purſu'd the <hi>Turks</hi> in their retreat towards <hi>Thebes,</hi> and kill'd and took Priſoners a great number of them. Many <hi>Graecian</hi> Families left <hi>Achaia</hi> to come into the <hi>Morea,</hi> and above Twelve thouſand Inhabitants (of which Three thouſand were able to bear Arms) did the ſame.

               <p>Many of the People of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> came daily to place themſelves under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of General <hi>Cornaro</hi>'s Army, ten Villages, with the Baſha that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, did the ſame.

In his retreat he laid an Ambuſcade for the Governour of <hi>Smocco,</hi> and having taken him caus'd his head to be cut off, without giving any ear to the Propoſitions he made of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Crowns for his Ranſom.</p>
               <p>Signior <hi>Cornaro</hi> Proveditor general of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> reſolv'd to lay Siege to <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> the Auxiliary Galleys having ſet out towards that Place, in order to joyn
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31594:85"/>the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces, but they would not obey him, becauſe he was but in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Proveditor general; but the Senate took away this difficulty by ſending him the <hi>Fanal,</hi> and the <hi>Gonfalon</hi> or Standard, with the Title of Captain General for that Campaign only.</p>
               <p>Some time before the Forces ſet out for the Siege of <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> they made an irruption into the Territory of <hi>Naren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and ſetting Fire to thirty Villages, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the deſign which Two thouſand <hi>Morlaques</hi> had of joyning themſelves to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Six hunder'd that were thought fit to bear Arms were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to joyn themſelves to the other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and diſpute the Paſſage with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels that were going to ſuccour <hi>Caſtel-Novo.</hi> The Baſha of <hi>Ertzegovine</hi> would alſo have hinder'd the <hi>Venetians</hi> from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Territory of <hi>Narenza,</hi> but was vigorouſly repuls'd and forc'd to fly.</p>
               <p>Chevalier <hi>Janco</hi> having put himſelf at the Head of a detachment of <hi>Morlaques,</hi> defeated a Party of Three hunder'd <hi>Turks,</hi> but it coſt him his Life, for as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cut off the head of a <hi>Turk</hi> whom
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31594:86"/>he had overthrown, the <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſhot off a Piſtol and kill'd him; his loſs was much reſented both by the <hi>Morlaques</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> eſpecially the latter; for ſince he had embrac'd their Intereſts he had done them very great Services, and by his Courage and Conduct contributed very much to their Conqueſts in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The following Relation of the Siege of <hi>Castel-Novo</hi> was ſent from <hi>Malta;</hi> we may well believe it exact, ſince it comes from a Knight of the Order, who was an Eye witneſs of what paſs'd in the Siege, and was himſelf in the greateſt occaſions of Danger.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Herbeſteim</hi> Grand Prior of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> and General of the Gallies of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> who beſides his Squadron of eight Galleys, had alſo under his command ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of thoſe belonging to the Pope, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd expreſs Orders both from his Holineſs and the Grand Maſter, not to joyn the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army in the <hi>Morea,</hi> Commanded by Generaliſſimo <hi>Moroſini,</hi> for fear of the Plague, having daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of their ſuſpicion that it was amongſt them, found himſelf out of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to employ him forces for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31594:86"/>of Chriſtendom, and after having been cruiſing on the Sea for the ſpace of three Months, he did but wait the Orders of the Grand Maſter to return to <hi>Malta,</hi> when he receiv'd, in <hi>Calabria</hi> on the 2d. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a Packet from <hi>Rome,</hi> by which he underſtood that his Holineſs had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make an Attempt on ſome of thoſe Places the <hi>Turks</hi> held in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> along the Gulf of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This news having made him haſten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that ſide, he arriv'd there on the ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and having advertis'd General <hi>Geronimo Cornaro</hi> of it, went to Anchor towards the Iſle of <hi>Lezina</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him there, who in the mean time was employ'd in gathering his Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: After they had had ſome mutual Correſpondence by Letters, they argreed on the Siege of <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his diligence General <hi>Cornaro</hi> could not be in readineſs to act till the latter end of the Month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſtel-Novo</hi> is a Place of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the <hi>Turks,</hi> Situate towards the Mouth of the Gulf of <hi>Caſtaro,</hi> which takes its name from another Place belonging to the Republique, lying at the lower end
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31594:87"/>of the Gulf, the Garriſon of which Place, as well as the Inhabitants of thoſe that are adjacent being ſubject to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> are always at blows with the Militia of <hi>Castel-Novo,</hi> by reaſon of which theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels are inur'd to War, and are eſteemed the moſt courageous and reſolute of all the Country. This Place is Situate on the Sea ſide, and extends it ſelf on two Lines, the one looking towards <hi>Albania,</hi> the other towards the City of <hi>Raguſa;</hi> and where it reaches furtheſt into the Land, there is a Caſtle that Commands the whole Town: Beſides this Caſtle there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or if you pleaſe an old faſhion'd Fort apart from the Caſtle, which covers it and guards its avenues. The Place is encompaſs'd with old faſhion'd Walls of thick and ſolid Stone-work, and flank'd with great Towers, between which there are ſome leſſer, and though it has no out-works, the Ground about it is ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous by reaſon of its unevenneſs, which forms certain Curtains where they may eaſily retrench, that it is incredible how difficult and dangerous the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches are.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:31594:87"/>
               <p>The Chriſtian Army, compos'd of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove One hunder'd Sail came within view of the Place, the 2d. of <hi>September</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening, ſtronger in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than effect, ſince all the reſt, but four Galleys, and two Men of War of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and five Galleys of <hi>Malta,</hi> were Ships of Burthen, and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The day following they were buſie in landing their Forces. Thoſe of the Republique to the number of Six or ſeven thouſand Men, choſe for that purpoſe a place ſome Miles diſtant from the Town; thoſe belonging to the Pope, and thoſe of <hi>Malta,</hi> who made but one Body of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Fifteen hunder'd Soldiers and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix Knights, Commanded by Chevalier <hi>Mechatin,</hi> General of the Forces of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> landed on a flat, much nearer, where a little open Plain gave means to keep the Infidels at a diſtance from the Coaſt by the Cannon of the Galleys, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtom taken the Poſt of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to go firſt againſt the Enemies.</p>
               <p>Our Men delay'd not to make tryal whether the Reputation of Courage, which the Inhabitants and Garriſon of <hi>Caſtel-Novo</hi> had gain'd, were well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:31594:88"/>or no; for theſe Infidels having poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves upon two Hills, the one commanding the other, and ſeparated by a great Valley, which was to be croſt, as well as the Hills, by difficult and rugged ways to come to the Town, began to fire upon our Men on all ſides to hinder their advance: But Chevalier <hi>Mechatin</hi> having made two ſtrong Detachments, one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chevalier <hi>de Mareüil,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd by a Body of the Knights, with whom was the Standard of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, born by the Commander <hi>de la Tour Maubourg,</hi> the other by Chevalier <hi>de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan Lezay,</hi> firſt Major of the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> with whom was a Party of his Holineſs's Forces conducted under him, by the Count <hi>Montevecchi,</hi> they fell upon the Enemy on both ſides with ſo much vigour, that after an obſtinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they were forc'd, in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, to quit the Poſts they had taken, and make a haſty retreat under their Walls with great loſs of their Men: Ours made themſelves Maſters of ſome Houſes and other Poſts of advantage within a large Musket-ſhot of the City, where they made a halt in the beginning of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:31594:88"/>might, which gave an occaſion to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to return in the dark, and retrench themſelves on the Hills, and ſome from which they were driven with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. In the mean time Count St. <hi>Paul</hi> and Chevalier <hi>Mechatin</hi> advanc'd in good Order with the Body of the Forces, who were rang'd in Battalia as ſoon as they came from the Coaſt. The reſolution with which the Chevaliers <hi>de Mareüil</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan</hi> marcht towards the Enemy, was ſuch, that it may be ſaid, that the terrour which it then ſtruck into them, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the cauſe of the happy ſucceſs of this Enterpriſe; but the Enemies firing very thick, and continuing it the whole day, they could not but loſe ſome of their Men, amongſt whom were the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers <hi>de Richebourg, de Barin,</hi> and <hi>de Guira,</hi> who dyed a few days after of their Wounds: The Chevaliers <hi>de Pernac, de Loumiers, Ventura, Caraffa,</hi> and <hi>Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceüill</hi> were there alſo hurt.</p>
               <p>From the 3d. day to the 8th. they were buſied in forming the Camp and Lines, and putting aſhore the Artillery and Mortars for the Bombs, the continual Rains having much incommoded them,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:31594:89"/>and by order of General St. <hi>Paul</hi> they began to raiſe a Battery of two Piece of Cannon to beat down a Houſe in which the <hi>Turks</hi> had fortifi'd themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fifty Paces of our retrenchments; but theſe Infidels remaining undaunted not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Fire of our great Guns, and giving us no ſmall vexation by their Musket-ſhot, it was reſolv'd on the eighth in the Morning to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of the Popes Forces and thoſe of <hi>Malta,</hi> under the command of Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <hi>Mareüil,</hi> and employ them to drive the <hi>Turks</hi> from that Poſt, The Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers commanded by Chevalier <hi>de Seire,</hi> and the Fueliers by Chevalier <hi>de Paulmy,</hi> advanc'd firſt and charg'd ſo furiouſly, that the Enemy not being able to bear the ſhock, fled away ſhamefully after ſome ſmart diſcharges, and quitted the Poſt, which ours immediately ſeiz'd. Then the Body of the Battalion of <hi>Malts</hi> advanc'd with the Standard of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at the ſight of which great ſhouts of joy in token of Victory being heard, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Chevaliers and Soldiers took occaſion from thence to advance farther, and with incredible vigour drove their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31594:89"/>to another great Houſe but five and twenty paces diſtant from their Walls, and being become Maſters of it, retrench'd themſelves there. This advantage coſt us dear; for though the <hi>Turks</hi> had not the Courage to maintain the place, yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of it being commanded by an higher ground of a continu'd aſcent, in form of an Amphitheatre, from whence the <hi>Turks</hi> gave terrible fire, as well as from the Walls of the City, and Caſtles, ſeveral of ours loſt their lives; four Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers being kill'd on the ſpot, and three and twenty dangerouſly wounded. Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>Mechatin</hi> perceiving that the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of his men carry'd them on too far, advanc'd on purpoſe to moderate them, and bring them back to the main body; but the <hi>Turks</hi> firing continually on all ſides, wounded Chevalier <hi>de Luſignan</hi> firſt Major, Chevalier <hi>de Seire</hi> Captain of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, and Chevalier <hi>de Senicourt de Seſſival,</hi> who died a few days after, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted by the whole Army for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable qualities.</p>

               <p>For ſeveral days following they very much incommoded the Beſieged by a Battery of eleven great piece of Cannon which was rais'd for the principal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, and a vaſt number of Bombs which they caſt into the place without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whilſt ours being lodg'd and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd in the Poſts they had gain'd, were buſied in advancing their Works in order to fix the Mine to the principal Tower of the Caſtle, by that time the Cannon ſhould make a conſiderable breach in the Walls, the deſign being at the ſame time to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault both the one and the other.</p>

                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:31594:91"/>piece without very great labour, which no way ſuiting with the impatient deſire of our men to come to blows with the Enemy, the rather for that the Seaſon began to be ſevere by continual Rain and daily Storms, all their deſigns turn'd to making the Breach wide enough for an Aſſault by the help of their Cannon; and while they were buſied in the execution of this project, two extraordinary things happen'd to our advantage.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, that two <hi>Turks</hi> who had fled from the place, came to General <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> and aſſur'd him, that if he would give them good uſage, they would ſo bring matters about, that ſeveral of the Town ſhould yield themſelves to him. This Propoſal having mov'd the General to uſe them well, one of them voluntarily remain'd in his power, as an Hoſtage, the other attended by a <hi>Morlaque</hi> of known truſt, return'd into the City, and there manag'd his Affairs with ſo much ſucceſs, that he came back two or three hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with two hundred and forty other <hi>Turks</hi> well arm'd and equipp'd. This odd Adventure gave occaſion to another accident which would have quite tired the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31594:92"/>conſtancy of any Garriſon leſs obſtinately reſolv'd to endure the laſt extremities: For General <hi>Cornaro</hi> ſeeing their Forces ſo conſiderably diminiſh'd, and taking from thence a freſh occaſion to ſummon them to ſurrender, threatning, that if they delay'd till the Aſſault, he would put them all to the Sword: They anſwer'd with their accuſtomed haughtineſs, that they were reſolv'd to defend the place to the laſt.</p>
               <p>Upon which we began to fire upon them, and one of our Bombs lighting by chance into a little Fort near the Sea-ſide where the Beſieged kept their Powder, and where the Women and Childten were put, as into a place of leaſt danger, the fire catching hold of this Powder, blew up the Fort, and all that was in it, making a diſmal ſpectacle, as may well be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd.</p>
               <p>On the ſame 28th. day the breach at laſt appearing reaſonable wide, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken to make advantage of the Conſternation into which ſo ſtrange an Adventure, in all probability, had caſt the Enemies, and give the Aſſault in two places; for which purpoſe a body was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:31594:92"/>fram'd of twelve hundred men. The Detachments of the Battalion of <hi>Malta,</hi> and the Pope's Forces, which made up one part of them, commanded by Chevalier <hi>de Paulmy,</hi> were to charge firſt on the right, on the ſide of the Caſtle, where the ſtrongeſt Aſſault was to be made, while the <hi>Florentines,</hi> with other <hi>Venetian</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commanded by the Marquiſs <hi>Borry,</hi> were to charge on the left, more towards the Sea, where there was a great Tower much batter'd by the Cannon.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all their Efforts, the Attempt had no ſucceſs, the Breach not being in that ſtate as was imagin'd. In fine, when Chevalier <hi>de Paulmy,</hi> with ſeveral Knights, and the Detachments commanded by him, had with great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour mounted the Breach, he plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, notwithſtanding the Enemies fire, that that place ſunk into a Precipice on the ſide of the beſieged, and that there was a ſtrong Paliſade behind, which the <hi>Turks</hi> were retrench'd, which with leſs difficulty, was found true after the taking of the Town. This impos'd upon him a neceſſity of contenting himſelf with the Proofs he had given of his Courage, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:31594:93"/>finding it impoſſible to make a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on that part of the Wall, which was ruin'd by the Caſtle, and lay open in ſeveral other places, he was forc'd to retire with loſs of Men. Dom <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Bru,</hi> Captain, was kill'd on the ſpot, and the Chevaliers <hi>d' Eſtaing, du Terail, de Cloſpac, de Chenau, de Glandenez,</hi> and <hi>de la Varene</hi> were grievouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Ours in the mean time endeavour'd to ſhake the Reſolution of the beſieged, and draw them to the ſide towards the Sea, by continual firing from the Galleys; the <hi>Saiques</hi> belonging to them, advanc'd under the Walls with Ladders, as if they intended to ſcale them; but then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd theſe Infidels were not men that eaſily took the Alarm; ſo far were they from being caught in the Snare that was laid for them, that on the contrary they ſeem'd more enrag'd, and defended the Breach like men in deſpair.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, the Marquis <hi>de Borry</hi>'s Attack, of which they had leſs hope ſucceeded much better, for the ruins of the great Tower prov'd ſuch, that he found means to mount them, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:31594:93"/>lodge himſelf there, the <hi>Turks</hi> not being able to make any great reſiſtance, the two Flanks of the ſame Tower (of which the Front only was ruin'd) ſerving him for a ſhelter from the fire of the Caſtle and other places near; ſo that now it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appear that this was the only part they ſhould have attack'd. The Forces of <hi>Malta</hi> who had crept along the Breach, being advanc'd to take their Poſt there, it might now eaſily be ſeen the Victory would not be long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd.</p>
               <p>In effect, the day following many of the Souldiers having poſted themſelves on ſeveral parts of the Wall from whence they had beaten the Beſieged; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral alſo having found means to get into the place, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtood their ground, and knock'd down a great number of them; but ſeeing ours did not ſlacken their Courage, but enter'd apace notwithſtanding their ſmart firing upon us, they reſolv'd at laſt to retire into the Caſtle, and leave the Town in our hands.</p>
               <p>There were ſome <hi>Turks</hi> who had taken refuge in the great Towers of the Town,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:31594:94"/>and had their Lives and Liberty granted them. The day following, being the 30th. of <hi>September,</hi> thoſe of the Caſtle having deſir'd leave to Capitulate, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred themſelves on condition that they might go out with their Arms; that it ſhould be permitted them to carry away whatever they could on their backs, and that they ſhould be allow'd Ships to carry them into <hi>Albania,</hi> which was punctually executed on the firſt of <hi>October.</hi> There went out above Nine hunder'd Men well arm'd who embarkt with about One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Women and Children: They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as 'tis ſaid, before the Siege ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the greateſt part of uſeleſs Souls: After this, thanks were given to God, and two Moſques that were in the Town, Conſecrated, the one being Dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin, the other to St. <hi>Jerom.</hi>

               <p>The Campaign ended with the taking of <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> which is the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Conqueſt that has been made in that Country during the preſent War.

I had forgot to tell you, that, as this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Army paſt by <hi>Napoli di Malvaſia,</hi> the only Place the <hi>Turks</hi> had now left in the <hi>Morea,</hi> Captain <hi>Venier</hi> was commanded with his Squadron to Bombard it. In effect, the Bombs being caſt into the Place with good ſucceſs, made a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſtruction, and the Bridge by which the City had Communication with the Continent was ruin'd: But all this not ſhaking the Reſolution the Garriſon had taken of defending themſelves, the Army paſs'd forward, hoping they ſhould eaſily reduce it the next Campaign, eſpecially ſince the Generaliſſimo had detach'd three Men of War and four Galliots, to block up the Place during the Winter, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from being reliev'd either with Men, Proviſions or Ammunition. Some Forces alſo on the Land kept it blockt up, to the end that the want of Proviſions might reduce this City under the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Republique, which could not be eaſily carry'd by force. Let us now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Siege of <hi>Athens.</hi>

               <p>Which oblig'd Count <hi>Coningsmark</hi> to raiſe two Batteries, one of ſix Cannon, the other of four Mortars, which were ready in a very ſhort time, and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons play'd the ſame Evening. In the mean time the Generaliſſimo ſent Fifteen hunder'd Men into the City, as well to ſeize it, as to preſerve the Houſes of thoſe <hi>Graecian</hi> Inhabitants who had voluntarily ſubmitted themſelves; after which they ſummon'd the Beſieged, who Proudly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd they were reſolv'd to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon which the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſaw themſelves oblig'd to work at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, where a Serjeant Major and ſome Soldiers were kill'd: the works were continu'd eight days together, and a great number of Bombs were thrown into

Fear had already ſeiz'd them, ſo that being of themſelves diſpos'd to deſire ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, they offer'd to ſurrender if they might go out with their Arms and Baggage. But the Generaliſſimo reduc'd their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to theſe conditions.</p>
